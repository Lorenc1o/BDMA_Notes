\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Artificial Intelligence
\series default
 is a wide concept, encompashing different aspects and fields.
 We can understand the term AI as the multidisciplinary field of study that
 aims at recreating human intelligence using artificial means.
 This is a bit abstract, and, in fact, there is no single definition for
 what this means.
 Intelligence is not fully understood, and thus it is hard to assess whether
 an artificial invention has achieved intelligence, further than intuitively
 thinking so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance, AI involves a whole variety of fields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Perception
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Knowledge
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cognitive System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Planning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Robotics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Machine Learning (Neural Networks)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Natural Language Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leveraging all of these, people try to recreate or even surpass human performanc
e in different tasks.
 For example, a computer program that can play chess better than any human
 could ever possibly play, such as Stockfish, or a system that is able to
 understand our messages and reply, based on the knowledge that it has learnt
 in the past, such as ChatGPT and similar tools.
 Other examples are self-driving cars, auto-controlled robots, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, AI is a very wide term, which merges many different scientific
 fields.
 
\series bold
Machine Learning
\series default
, on the other side, is a narrower term, which deals with the study of the
 techniques that we can use to make a computer learn to perform some task.
 It takes concepts from Statistics, Optimization Theory, Computer Science,
 Algorithms, etc.
 A relevant subclass of Machine Learning, which has come to be one of the
 most prominent fields of research in the recent years, is 
\series bold
Neural Networks 
\series default
or 
\series bold
Deep Learning
\series default
, which consists on an ML technique based on the human brain.
 Many amazing use cases that we see everywhere, like Siri (Apple assistant),
 Cortana (Windows assistant), Amazon recommender system, Dall-E (OpenAI
 image generation system), etc.
 Not only this, but the trend is growing, and the interest in DL is continuously
 increasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is partly also due to the increase in computing resources, and the
 continuous optimization that different techniques are constantly experiencing.
 For instance, for a model trained on one trillion data points, in 2021
 the training process required around 16500x less compute than a model trained
 in 2012.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But not everything is sweet and roses when using DL.
 Since these systems are being involved in decision making processes, there
 are some questions that arise, like whose responsibility is it when a model
 fails? Moreover, data is needed to train the models, so it is relevant
 to address how datasets should be collected, and to respect the privacy
 of the people thhat produce data.
 In addition, the recent technologies that are able to generate new content
 and to modify real content, make it a new issue that AI can create false
 information, mistrust, and even violence or paranoia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonetheless, let's not focus on the negative, there are lots of nice application
s of DL, and it is a key component to deal with data, achieving higher performan
ce than traditional ML techniques for huge amount of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
AI History
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1950, Alan turing aimed to answer the question '
\emph on
Can machines think?
\emph default
' through a test, which came to be named the 
\series bold
Turing Test
\series default
, and consists in a 3 players game.
 First, a similar game is the following: 2 talkers, a man and a female,
 and 1 interrogator.
 The interrogator asks questions to the talkers, with the aim of determining
 who is the man and who is the female.
 The man tries to trick the interrogator, while the woman tries to help
 him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the Turing Test consists in replacing the man by an artificial machine.
 Turing thought that a machine that could trick a human interrogator, should
 be considered intelligent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Later, in 1956, in the Dartmouth Workshop organized by IBM, the term 
\series bold
Artificial Intelligence
\series default
 was first used to describe 
\emph on
every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so
 precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it
\emph default
.
