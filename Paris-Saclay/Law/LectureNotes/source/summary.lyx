Rule of Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
General rule imposed on human beings living in society and punished by public
 authority.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
rule of Law
\emph default
 is a fundamental principle that governs how a society operates.
 It means that all individuals, institutions and entities, public or private,
 including the state itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly promulgat
ed, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent
 with international human rights principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Characteristics
\series default
 of the 
\emph on
rule of Law
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Generality
\series default
: It targets everyone, or some specific kind of people, and it is applied
 equally.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Mandatory
\series default
: rules established by law must be followed, and there are consequences
 of not doing so.
 This happens regardless of the kind of rule:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Imperative rules: non-negotiable demands of the law.
 These define what must or must not be done.
 For example, criminal laws that prohibit theft.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Complementary rules: norms that can be modified or set aside by the parties
 involved, usually in the context of private law.
 For instance, parties entering into a contract can agree on terms that
 deviate from standard legal provisions as long as they do not violate imperativ
e rules or public policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both types of rules are mandatory as they establish a framework of legal
 obligations, but they differ in how strictly they bind the parties and
 their flexibility.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Validity
\series default
: refers to the legitimacy or authority of the legal rule.
 For a law to be considered valid:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It must be created by a legitimate authority or legislator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It must follow the proper procedure for legislation, which often includes
 debate, public consultation, and adherence to constitutional principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It must be promulgated or published, making it known to the public before
 it can be enforced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This characteristic ensures that laws are not arbitrary but are created
 through a recognized legal process that confers legitimacy and legal force.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Sanctionability
\series default
: once the rule is chosen, it will be applied with the risk of a sanction.
 Sanctions are the consequences or penalties for violating a law, and they
 serve as a deterrent against illegal behavior.
 This principle is crucial for the rule of law because it ensures that laws
 are not just theoretical but have practical effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While 
\series bold
legal rules
\series default
 are formal, codified norms enforced by the state to regulate behavior and
 maintain order, 
\series bold
moral rules
\series default
 are informal, subjective norms based on ethical principles and values that
 guide individual behavior.
 
\series bold
Natural law
\series default
, meanwhile, is a philosophical theory suggesting the existence of universal,
 inherent moral principles that should underpin human-made laws and ethical
 behavior.
 Each of these norms plays a distinct role in shaping human conduct, societal
 norms, and legal systems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Classification of Legal Rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Public Law
\series default
: governs the relationship between individuals and the state, as well as
 the relationships between different branches of the state.
 It is subcaterogized as:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Constitutional Law
\series default
: the foundation of the legal system of a country.
 It outlines the structure of the government, the distribution of powers
 among different branches (executive, legislative, judicial), and the fundamenta
l rights and freedoms of citizens.
 It is the highest law, against which all other laws are evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Administrative Law
\series default
: covers the rules and procedures that govern administrative agencies of
 the government.
 It deals with the actions and decisions of government departments and agencies,
 including rulemaking, enforcement of laws, issuing permits, and resolving
 disputes involving public administration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
International Public Law
\series default
: governs the conduct of states and international organizations.
 It encompasses treaties, conventions, and customs that regulate interactions
 between sovereign nations, including issues related to war, diplomacy,
 human rights, and territorial boundaries.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Private Law
\series default
: deals with the relationships between private individuals or entities.
 It governs legal disputes that involve private parties and their rights
 and obligations.
 It is subcategorized as:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
International Private Law
\series default
: deals with cases where foreign elements are involved, determining which
 jurisdiction's law applies to a legal dispute and how judgements from one
 jurisdiction are recognized and enforced in another.
 For example, when two parties from different countries sign a contract,
 the matter of deciding which national law shall apply to the contract is
 a matter of international private law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Civil Law
\series default
: the core of private law.
 It covers non-criminal disputes between individuals and entities, including
 laws on contracts, property, family relations, and inheritance.
 It establishes the rights and duties of private parties in their interactions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Commercial Law
\series default
: it is a subset of civil law, that deals with issues related to commerce
 and trade between businesses and individuals, including contracts, transactions
 and business organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Labor Law
\series default
: this area governs the relationship between employers and employees, including
 employment contracts, labor rights, working conditions and collective bargainin
g.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Mixed
\series default
: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Procedural Law
\series default
: encompasses the rules that govern how courts and other legal institutions
 handle civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings.
 It includes the procedures for filing cases, conducting trials, and appealing
 decisions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Criminal Law
\series default
: governs crimes and punishments.
 It defines what constitutes criminal behavior and specifies the sanctions
 (punishments) for such behavior.
 While it primarily deals with offenses against the state or society at
 large, it has elements of both public law (the state prosecutes offenders)
 and private law (in aspects like victim compensation).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Sources of the Rule of Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Before the French Revolution, local laws in what is now France were divided
 between the 
\series bold
Germanic customary laws
\series default
 in the north and the 
\series bold
Roman laws
\series default
 in the south.
 There laws were based on local customs and traditions, with Roman law influenci
ng the legal systems due to the Roman Empire's historical presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Ordinances and Edicts of the King
\series default
 began to replace local customary laws.
 Ordinances were more general laws, while edicts could address specific
 issues or grant rights and privileges.
 This centralization of legal authority under the monarchy was a step towards
 a unified legal system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the 
\emph on
ancien régime
\emph default
 of France, there were 
\series bold
Parlements
\series default
, which were sovereign courts that registered the king's edicts and could
 protest against them, although they could not ultimately prevent their
 enforcement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In addition, there was the 
\series bold
Canon Law
\series default
, the law governing the Church and its members, which was a significant
 source of law in Europe before the French revolution, especially in matters
 of marriage, legitimacy and inheritance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now, there are other sources of the contemporary law, divided into international
 and national sources:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
International Sources
\series default
: 
\series bold
treaties
\series default
 are international agreements that countries are bound to follow.
 The article 55 of the French Constitution acknowledges the superiority
 of treaties over national laws, provided they are ratified according to
 the constitution.
 In addition, there is the 
\series bold
European Union Law
\series default
, which is based on the Treaty of Rome (1957), that established the European
 Economic Community, now part of the European Union.
 EU law includes regulations and directives issued by EU institutions like
 the European Commision and the European Council, which have direct or indirect
 effect on member states' laws and take precedence over national legislation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
National Sources
\series default
: the 
\series bold
Law
\series default
 referes to statutes passed by the Parliament, while 
\series bold
regulations
\series default
 are issued by the executive branch (the government) and deal with matters
 not expressly reserved for law.
 In addition, there are 
\series bold
decrees
\series default
 and 
\series bold
orders
\series default
, which are forms of regulation dealing with specific issues or individual
 matters, not considered as the law in the broader sense.
 For example, a decree might appoint public officials to certain administrative
 positions, or an order might impose temporary restrictions on water use
 in response to a severe drought in a department.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, we find the 
\series bold
Constitution
\series default
, which is the supreme legal document, defining the fundamental principles
 and the organization of the state.
 It outlines the domain of laws passed by Parliament (matters of personal
 status, fundamental principles) and the Executive branch's authority to
 issue regulations on matters not covered by law, except as specified in
 articles 38 and 16 of the French Constitution.
 Article 38 allows the government to legislate by ordinance in areas delegated
 by Parliament, while Article 16 grants the President exceptional powers
 under certain crisis conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Drafting of a Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Initiative
\series default
: the process of creating a new law begins with the initiative, which can
 be taken by the Prime Minister or member of the Parliament.
 This involves the drafting and proposal of a new law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Examination and voting
\series default
: the proposed law is examined, debated, and voted on by each assembly of
 Parliament (the National Assembly and the Senate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Promulgation
\series default
: after a law is passed by Parliament, it is promulgated by the President
 of the Republic through a decree.
 Promulgation is the formal declaration that the law is enforceable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Publication
\series default
: the law is then published in the official gazette, and it becomes enforceable
 the day after its publication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, it must be ensured that the law complies with higher sources
 of law:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Constitutionality
\series default
: the Constitutional Council examines the constitutionality of the new law
 before its promulgation.
 This can be requested as a preliminary ruling on constitutionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Review of legality
\series default
: there's also a mechanism for reviewing the legality of regulations, which
 can be challenged a posteriori (after the fact) by someone claiming a legitimat
e interest, either by 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

voie d'action
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 (direct action) or 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

voie d'exception
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\emph default
(as a defense in court proceedings).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Revoke of Laws and Regulations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Laws and regulations do not automatically fall into disuse: they must be
 explicitly or implicitly revoked.
 The principle is that law remain in force until revoked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Case Law or Judicial Precedence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judges in France are expected to enforce the law.
 However, judicial decisions can create law under certain conditions, such
 as when the law is unclear or when new, unforeseen situations arise.
 Article 4 of the Civil Code mandates that judges must make a decision even
 in the absence of clear, precise laws, under penalty of being charged with
 denial of justice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, according to Article 1355 of the Civil Code, a judgment only has
 authority in relation to the specific case it resolves and does not create
 regulatory judgments applicable to all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore...
 
\series bold
do judges create the rule of law?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While judges do not create laws in the legislative sense, their interpretations
 and decisions in unclear or new situations can influence the development
 of the law.
 They do not create rules that have general applicability like laws passed
 by Parliament, but can set precedents within the bounds of existing laws
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other Sources of Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Customs
\series default
 are established practices that are considered legally binding, even though
 they are not formal laws.
 Customs can be used to interpret and complete the law, provided they are
 not 
\emph on
contra legem
\emph default
 (against the law).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Legal doctrine
\series default
 refers to scholarly legal writings that can influence legal interpretations
 and the development of the law.
 Legal doctrine is not binding like laws or regulations but can be persuasive
 in legal reasoning and decision-making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Applicability of the Rule of Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Applicability of Law in Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
French Law applies throughout the entire country to everyone living in the
 national territory, with the exception of local legal systems surviving
 in Alsace Lorraine and in some territories outside continental France.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Applicability of Law in Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle is the 
\series bold
non-retroactivity of Laws
\series default
.
 Article 2 of the Civil Code states that a new law applies only to the future
 and does not have a retroactive effect.
 This means that actions taken and situations that arose before the new
 law's enactment are governed by the law as it was at that time.
 The rationale behind this principle is to protect legal certainty and individua
l's trust in the law, ensuring that people can plan their actions according
 to the law without fear of future changes affecting them retroactively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the new law may apply to ongoing legal situations without retroactive
 effect.
 For instance, a new law may apply to continuing contracts or relationships,
 affecting the rights and obligations of the parties from the date of the
 law's enactment forward, without altering the legal situation that existed
 before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some 
\series bold
exceptions
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Retroactive laws by nature: certain types of laws are designed to have retroacti
ve effects.
 These include:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
More clement criminal laws: if a new criminal law is more favorable to the
 defendant, it can be applied retroactively to past actions.
 This exception is rooted in the principle of lenity (courts should interpret
 the law in the way most favorable to the defendant), which aims to ensure
 fairness in the administration of justice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Interpretative laws: these laws clarify the intended meaning of previous
 legislation without changing the legal rule itself.
 Since they aim to explain what the law always meant, they can be applied
 to situations that occured before their enactment.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Decision of the legislative power: the legislators may explicitly decide
 that a particular law should have retroactive effect.
 This is usually done in specific cases where the lawmakers deem it necessary
 for the law to address past situations, subject to constitutional and human
 rights considerations that may limit the ability to legislate retroactively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Subjective Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subjective rights are legal rights that belong to individuals or legal entities,
 granting them the authority to perform certain actions or to demand certain
 behaviors from others, based on the legal system's recognition of those
 rights.
 They are 
\emph on
subjective
\emph default
 because they are granted to individuals, the 
\emph on
subjects
\emph default
 of the law.
 They are considered subjective in contrast to 
\emph on
objective law
\emph default
, which refers to the body of laws, norms, and statutes that govern society
 as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Patrimonial Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patrimonial rights are economic in nature, can be assessed financially,
 and relate to an individual's assets and liabilities.
 They can be transferred, seized, and have commercial value.
 These rights can be subdivided into:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Patrimony (property)
\series default
: refers to the total sum of an individual's rights and obligations with
 economic value.
 It's a legal universality, distinct from the individual assets or liabilities
 it comprises.
 The key characteristics are:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Inalienability: it cannot be transferred except by death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Singular nature: a person only has one patrimony.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Rights in Rem (real rights)
\series default
: these are rights directly over things, giving the holder a direct and
 immediate authority over the property.
 This includes:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Principal rights in Rem
\series default
: concern the ownership and use of property, which itself can be broken
 down into the right of usus (use), fructus (enjoyment of fruits, i.e., rent),
 and abusus (disposition, including sale or destruction).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Rights in Rem Accesories
\series default
: these are a type of right that serves as security interests.
 Unlike principal rights in rem, these are secondary rights that secure
 the performance of an obligation, usually the payment of a debt.
 They are 
\emph on
accessory
\emph default
 because their existence depends on a principal obligation.
 Therefore, these are guarantees for creditors, such as pledges (a right
 over a movable asset, which the creditor can sell if the debtor fails to
 repay the loan) and mortgages (a right over immovable property).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Intellectual Property Rights
\series default
: these are rights based on intangible assets, including:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Literary and Artistic Property: covers copyright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Industrial property: includes patents, trademarks, designs and models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Right of clientele: relates to the commercial exploitation of a business's
 customer base.
 This right refers to the value associated to the customer base of a business.
 It is specially relevant in commercial entreprises and professional practices
 where the ongoing relationship with customers or clients contributes significan
tly to the business's value.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Patrimonial rights can be commercialized (sold, leased, etc.), transmitted
 during the owner's lifetime or upon death, seized by creditors, and may
 become extinct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extrapatrimonial Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Extrapatrimonial rights are non-economic, related to personal and family
 dignity and integrity, cannot be commercialized, and are inalienable and
 imprescriptible.
 They include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Family Rights
\series default
: such as parental rights, which govern the relationship between parents
 and their children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Individual Rights
\series default
: including the right to one's name, honor, image rights, and the right
 to privacy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Moral Rights of the Author
\series default
: protect the personal and reputational interests of creators, such as the
 right to be recognized as the author of a work and to prevent any changes
 in the work that harms the creator's honor or reputation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key features of extrapatrimonial rights are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Non-marketable: cannot be sold or bought.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cannot be included in one's patrimony.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Inalienable: cannot be transferred, seized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Imprescriptible: not subject to expiration or limitation over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sources of Subjective Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\series bold
Legal Acts
\series default
 are actions taken by individuals or legal entities with the intention of
 creating, modifying, transferring, or extinguishing legal rights and obligation
s.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These can be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Bilateral acts
\series default
: these involve two or more parties and include agreements or contracts,
 where each party, undertakes certain obligations towards the others.
 For example, a sales contract involves a buyer agreeing to pay a price
 and a seller agreeing to deliver goods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Unilateral acts
\series default
: these are actions taken by one party that can create legal obligations
 or rights, even without the consent of others.
 For instance, a will is a unilateral act where a person decides the distributio
n of their estate after their death without needing agreement from the beneficia
ries.

\begin_layout Standard
Legal acts are further categorized based on their nature and purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Acts of disposal
\series default
: these involve transferring or renouncing a right or interest in property.
 Selling a piece of land is an act of disposal because it transfer the ownership
 from the seller to the buyer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Acts of administration
\series default
: these are actions taken to manage and maintain an asset without altering
 its substance or ownership structure, like leasing a property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Conservative acts
\series default
: these are measures taken to preserve the value or condition of an asset,
 such as repairs or maintenance work on a property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition

\series bold
Legal Facts
\series default
 refer to events or situations that create, modify, or extinguish legal
 rights and obligations, independent of the will or intention of the parties
 involved.
 These can be natural events (like birth and death) or human actions that
 are not intended as legal acts but still have legal consequences.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Article 1242-3 et seq.
\series default
: these are related to example of creation of a right in response to a fact.
 For example, when a person makes a payment thinking they are paying a debt,
 which did not exist (fact), they have the right to reclaim the payment
 from the recipient.
 A similar situation arises when someone pays intentionally someone else's
 debt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Legal facts differ from legal acts in that they do not stem from the deliberate
 intention to bring about legal effects.
 For example, the death of a person is a legal fact that triggers the distributi
on of the deceased's estate according to their will (a unilateral legal
 act) or the law of succession if there is no will.

this latin maxim means 'the burden of the proof lies with the demander'.
 In legal disputes, the party making the claim (demander) must provide evidence
 to support their claim.
 Conversely, the defender may need to present evidence to refute the claim
 or support their defense.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof experiences a 
\series bold
back and forth movement
\series default
, because the burden of the proof may shift between parties during a trial,
 depending on the initial evidence presented and the legal context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The judge's role is to remain neutral in the evidence-gathering process,
 not actively seeking proof but rather evaluating the evidence presented
 by the parties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An exception to the standard proof requirement is the 
\series bold
legal presumption system
\series default
, where certain facts are presumed to be true unless proven otherwise.
 This includes simple presumptions (which can be rebutted) and irrefragable
 presumptions (which cannot be contested), as explained in Article 1351
 regarding the authority of adjudicated cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Systems of Legal Evidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is 
\series bold
freedom of evidence
\series default
 when evidence can be introduced in any form, as long as it is relevant
 and legally obtained.
 This is the case of criminal law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other cases, the system is 
\series bold
legally defined
\series default
, where proofs must follow specific rules for evidence, often requiring
 written form or other legally defined standards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Civil law is a mixed system, where facts can be freely proved without strict
 formality, but legal acts must follow specific rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Written evidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Written evidence is crucial and often required for proving legal acts, with
 the law of March 13, 2000, and Article 1316 of the Civil Code defining
 what constitutes valid written evidence, in order to obtain its 
\series bold
binding nature
\series default
: 
\emph on
'a sequence of letters, numbers, printed or other symbols, a sequence that
 must be understandable and decipherable by others'
\emph default
.
 The 
\series bold
function of the signature
\series default
 is defined in Article 1316-4, as to identify the signer and express consent
 to the document's obligations: 
\emph on
'identifying the person who signs, expressing his or her consent to the
 obligations resulting from the document'
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two essential conditions for the validity of written evidence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The person must be identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The conservation of the document must guarantee its integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Written evidence can be of several types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Authentic Acts: official documents prepared by public officers (like notaries
 or civil registrars) with legal power.
 These documents have a high degree of reliability and enforceability.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A notarial deed is comprised of a 'minute' kept by the notary and an authentic
 copy sent to the parties.
 When the copy is said to be enforceable, it authorizes the use of the enforceme
nt agencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The document is considered valid until it is recorded as false for the observed
 information by the public officer and until the reality is proved for the
 other elements
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Private Deeds: documents signed by the parties involved, requiring a certain
 number of original copies and specific details:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Should be sign by the parties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Be written with as many original copies as parties (Article 1325 of the
 Civil Code).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Commitment to pay should bear the amount of the quantity in numbers and
 letters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Binding unless proved otherwise.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Paragraph
Electronic medium and signatures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Electronic signatures and documents are 
\series bold
legally recognized
\series default
, with specific requirements for validity, identification, and integrity
 outlined in Articles 1367 and 1316-4 of the Civil Code, and enforced by
 the law of June 21, 2004.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 
\series bold
technical requirements
\series default
, and reliability and integrity of electronic signatures are ensured through
 technologies like asymmetric key encryption and third-party certifiers,
 as detailed in the Decre of March 30, 2001.
 The system must guarantee the document's unaltered state and authenticate
 the signer's identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The technical solution must not result in any alteration of the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The verification is based on an electronic qualified certificate, which
 guarantees the authenticity of the signature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a large number of technical rules, and the qualification of the
 third party is equivalent to a presumption of respect of those rules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Electronic Archives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, and original copy is a document that is officialy signed
 by the parties involved in a legal deed.
 In the context of electronic documents, an 
\series bold
original copy
\series default
 refers to a digital version that serves the same legal purpose as a paper
 document.
 The original copy has 
\series bold
legal importance ad probationem/ad validatem
\series default
, which are latin terms referring to the legal significance of documents
 for the purpose of the proof (ad probationem) and for fulfilling legal
 requirements to validate a deed or contract (ad validatem).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Article 1375 of the Civil Code adapts the requirement for mutiple original
 copies to the digital age.
 It stipulates that for electronic contracts, the requirement is met if
 the deed is established and maintained in a way that complies with articles
 1366 and 1367 of the Civil Code, ensuring that each party can access of
 obtain a copy of the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Validity of the Copy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Article 1379 of the Civil Code says that a copy must be an identical
 and durable reproduction of the original, not signed (as that would make
 it another original), and must maintain the same legal value as the original.
 The copy must accurately reproduce both the form and content of the original
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
Afnor Z 42-013
\series default
 standard specifies requirements for electronic archiving systems, ensuring
 that all necessary information is preserved accurately and reliably, making
 it retrievable for its intended purposes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if the original copy exists, the judge may require it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Other Forms of Evidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Evidence through a witness
\series default
: witness statements are considered based on predetermined rules in the
 Code of Civil Procedure, with the judge assessing their admissibility and
 weight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Evidence by the presumption of facts
\series default
: Article 1382 allows judges to consider presumptions based on serious,
 precise, and corroborating evidence, but it is not binding on them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Proof of admission
\series default
: admission in judicial inquiries is considered irrevocable and binding,
 unlike admissions made outside of court, which are not binding.
 This is, if you admit to be guilty in front of the court, then you are
 legally guilty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Proof by oath
\series default
: legal mechanism where a party to a legal proceeding is asked to affirm
 the truthfulness of their statements or claims under oath.
 This method of proof relies on the solemn declaration or affirmation made
 by a party or witness, asserting the truth of certain facts or denials
 in dispute.
 There are tipically two types of oaths used as proof:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Decisive oath
\series default
: requested by one party for the other to take.
 Its probative strength is absolute.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Additional oath
\series default
: may be requested by the judge to complement other evidence, not absolute
 in its probatory value.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Use of Evidence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Statutory facts
\series default
 are those that must be established or proven in court to meet the legal
 criteria set by statutes for various purposes, like determining legal rights
 or liabilities, qualifying for exceptions or exemptions, or triggering
 or preventing legal actions.
 For example, in the context of family law, statutory facts might include
 the circumstances of a marriage or the parentage of a child, which are
 relevant to legal issues like custody, support, and inheritance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of evidence in statutory facts is characterized by being free for
 civil status or filiation: this means that for matters concerning an individual
's civil status (e.g., birth, marriage, death) or filiation (determining parent-ch
ild relationship), the law allows flexibility in the types of evidence that
 can be presented, except in certain cases where specific legal restrictions
 may apply.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Proof by legal documents
\series default
 (article 1341 of the Civil Code): legal documents are the primary source
 of evidence for asserting claims or defenses in court.
 These documents need to meet certain legal requirements to be considered
 valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In principle, documentary evidence is needed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In principle, 
\series bold
a legal document is necessary
\series default
: generally, a written document is required to prove a legal act or transaction,
 reflecting the principle that written evidence provides a clear and durable
 record of agreements, rights and obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exceptions - 
\series bold
Oaths and Admission
\series default
: in situations where a legal document is not available, an individual's
 oath (solemn promise regarding the truth of the information provided) or
 admission (a party's acknowledgement of a fact) can be accepted as evidence.
 In commercial litigation, the rules are more indulgent, allowing a wider
 range of evidence to be used (free evidence).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Prima Facie Evidence
\series default
 (Article 1347): refers to evidence that is accepted as sufficient to prove
 a fact unless contradicted and overcome by other evidence.
 It includes situations where:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
It was materially or morally impossible to create a legal document at the
 time of the transaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A legal document was lost or destroyed due to force majeure (an unforeseeable
 and unavoidable event).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A legally defined copy is a copy of a document that meets legal standards.
 This can serve as evidence in the absence of the original.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Acts involving less than 1500€ can be proved by any means, offering flexibility
 in how evidence can be presented in smaller claims.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proof against or beyond a legal document: if evidence is presented that
 contradicts or extends beyond what is contained in a legal document, another
 document is required to support the new evidence, regardless of the monetary
 value involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Legal System
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In France, there is what is called a 
\series bold
Dual Jurisdiction
\series default
, which refers to the coexistence of two main types of jurisdiction: administrat
ive and judicial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Administrative Jurisdiction
\series default
: Deals with disputes involving public administration, government agencies,
 and the actions of the government.
 It is separate from the ordinary courts and has its own hierarchy, with
 the Council of State (Conseil d'État) at the top.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Judicial Jurisdiction
\series default
: Handles civil and criminal cases involving individuals and private law
 disputes.
 This jurisdiction is what most people typically encounter when they go
 to court.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Court of Jurisdictional Conflict
\series default
: A special court that resolves disputes over whether a case should be heard
 by the administrative or judicial courts, ensuring that there is a clear
 demarcation between the two jurisdictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
principle of Double Degree of Jurisdiction
\series default
 guarantees that most decisions from a first instance court can be appealed
 to a higher court.
 It's a fundamental right ensuring that parties have the opportunity for
 a second hearing.
 However, there are exceptions for minor cases, where appeals may be limited
 to prevent an overload of the judicial system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also find a classification of courts, regarding their hierarchy and specializ
ation.
 For instance, courts dealing with criminal matters are classified according
 to 
\series bold
criminal jurisdictions
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Tribunal de police
\series default
: deals with minor offenses (contraventions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Tribunal correctionnel

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Exceptional jurisdictions
\series default
: includes a court for specific types of defendants or crimes, such as minors
 or members of the government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, there are

 reviewing facts and law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Cour de cassation
\series default
: the highest court in French legal system, which reviews lower court decisions
 to ensure they correctly applied the law.
 It does not retry cases but instead focuses on legal principles.
 Its decisions are final, and it can return cases for a new trial if it
 finds a lower court decision was based on a misinterpretation of the law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Civil Proceedings

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
The Transaction 
\series default
(Article 2044 of the Civil Code) refers to a legal mechanism where parties

 trial.
 It's a form of settlement that is legally binding and often used to avoid
 lengthy and costly proceedings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

judicial staff 
\series default
is categorized into judges (magistrates) and prosecutors, with distinctions
 between their roles and personal status:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Judges/Magistrates
\series default
: can be non-professional (in commercial or labor courts, for example, it
 is possible that a matter is subject to a non-professional judge, who is
 an expert in the matter) or professional (people that have studied to be
 a judge), with the primary responsibility of resolving disputes by interpreting
 laws, assessing the facts of the case, and issuing judgements accordingly.
 They are part of the

 Their role is to enforce the law and ensure public order.
 Prosecutors are legal officials who represents the state or the public
 in criminal trials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, there are various professionals who assist the functioning
 of the judicial system:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Greffiers (clerks of the court)
\series default
: responsible for maintaining the records of court proceedings and assisting
 with administrative duties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

Contract Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contract Law is a fundamental aspect of legal studies that deals with the
 rules and principles governing agreements between parties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Understanding the classification of contracts helps in grasping the legal
 implications and obligations that contracts impose on the parties involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Classification Depending on the Type of Contract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Named contracts
\series default
 have specific designations and are recognized by law, such as sales, leasing,
 service contracts, work, deposit, and company agreements.
 The advantage of named contracts is that they are already established by
 law, which can be either supplementary (optional) or mandatory (compulsory).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Unnamed contracts
\series default
, on the other hand, are complex and unique (
\emph on
sui generis
\emph default
).
 These contracts do not fit into the predefined categories and may require
 special consideration and interpretation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to note that this classification does not bind judges: there
 is 
\series bold
judicial discretion
\series default
.
 In cases of mistakes or dissimulation (concealment of truth), a judge has
 the discretion to interpret the contract beyond its classification.
 For example, a contract may be classified as a service contract, while
 the reality behind the contract is a work relation.
 In this case, the judge can interpret the contract as a work contract,
 even if it classified by the parties as a service contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contracts can also be classified as 
\series bold
general agreements
\series default
 or 
\series bold
accessory agreements
\series default
, highlighting the primary versus supplementary nature of the contractual
 obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Classification Depending on the Object
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Bi-/Multi-Lateral (Synallagmatic) Agreements
\series default
: according to the Article 1106 of the Civil Code, synallagmatic agreements
 create recriprocal obligations for all parties involved.
 This means each party has duties towards the others, establishing a mutual
 dependency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Unilateral Agreements
\series default
: conversely, Article 1106 of the Civil Code also mentions that unilateral
 agreements impose obligations on one party alone.
 This type of contract involves a single party's commitment without requiring
 a reciprocal promise from another party.
 For example, I can post an offer of a reward in exchange for a lost wallet,
 setting up an unilateral agreement that stipulates that the reward will
 be issued once my wallet is found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This distinction is particularly relevant for mechanisms such as the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exception d'inexécution
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 (defense of non-performance), which includes suspension, resolution, and
 risk theory.
 These mechanisms allow parties to respond to breaches of contract in a
 manner that reflects the mutual or unilateral nature of their agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proof of contracts and their terms is subject to the dual original exigency,
 as stated in Article 1375.
 This means that establishing the existence and specifics of a contract
 often requires adherence to strict legal standards, emphasizing the importance
 of clear, mutual agreements and understanding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Free-of-Charge Contracts or Contracts Drawn Up in Return for Payment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contracts can be also classified based on the presence or absence of a financial
 consideration:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Free-of-Charge Contracts
\series default
: these are agreements where one party benefits without a requirement to
 provide a financial return to the other party.
 For example, in a donation, one party, the donor, transfers ownership of
 property or a sum of money to another party, the donee, without expecting
 anything in return.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Contracts Drawn Up in Return for Payment
\series default
: these involve transactions where services of goods are exchanged for payment.
 They can be either reciprocal or unilateral in nature, depending on whether
 both or one party is obligated to provide something of value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the realm of return-for-payment contracts, further subdivisions include
 commutative and aleatory contracts, both of which are forms of synallagmatic
 agreements:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Commutative contracts
\series default
: these contracts involve exchanges where the reciprocal advantages are
 immediately known and can be evaluated.
 Each party knows what to expect and what is expected in return.
 For example, a sales contract, in which one party sells a product to the
 other party for a certain amount of money.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Aleatory contracts
\series default
: these are characterized by uncertainty.
 The advantages or obligations depend on an uncertain event (
\emph on
aléa
\emph default
).
 The risk can be inherent to the contract's nature or introduced by the
 parties' agreement.
 The principle here is that hazard nullifies tort (
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

l'aléa chasse la lésion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
), meaning a contract cannot be nullified due to the absence of cause or
 because of an unfair disadvantage (
\emph on
lésion
\emph default
), except in specific cases related to the aleatory element, like in life-contin
gent annuities (
\emph on
rente viagère
\emph default
).
 These contracts reflects an economic application of game theory, where
 the principle of large numbers does not apply uniformly, affected by the
 parties' quality.
 An example of an aleatory contract is a life insurance policy, where the
 obligations of the parties involved depend on an uncertain event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Instantaneous Contracts and Contracts of Continuing Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The execution timeline of contracts introduces another layer of classification:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Instantaneous contracts
\series default
: these are executed in a single action or step.
 Once the agreed exchange is made, the contract is considered fulfilled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Contracts of continuing performance
\series default
: these require a certain period to be fully executed, establishing ongoing
 obligations over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interest of distinguishing between these types lies in the implications
 for declaring invalidity.
 For contracts of continuing performance, rescinding or terminating the
 agreement can significantly impact the contractual relationship, affecting
 how and when parties can exit the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distinction between instantaneous and continuing performance contracts
 is 
\series bold
relative
\series default
.
 A series of instantaneous contracts can collectively resemble a continuing
 performance contract, especially in scenarios like a processing contract
 or in the event of bankruptcy, where the ongoing nature of obligations
 comes to the forefront.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Contracts That Are Limited in Time or With A Termination Date
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contracts of continuing performance often include provisions for 
\series bold
tacit renewal
\series default
.
 This means that even without explicit agreement, the contract can automatically
 renew under certain conditions.
 Such provisions allow for a seamless continuation of the agreement, provided
 both parties continue to fulfill their obligations without objection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contract might be set without a specific deadline, being its end dependent
 of a particular event.
 According to a ruling by the Cour de Cassation on October 28, 1992, the
 event triggering the contract's end must be independent of the parties'
 will.
 This ensures the contract's continuity is not arbitrarily controlled by
 either party, providing a fair and predictable framework for its duration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For contracts without a fixed duration, unilateral termination is generally
 permissible at any time.
 However, this termination must not be abusive (
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in case of excess
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
) and should be executed with a reasonable period of advance notice.
 The flexibility allows parties to exit agreements when they no longer serve
 their mutual interests, provided they do so considerately and fairly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Article 1738 of the Civil Code provides a legal framework for tacit renewal,
 especially in the context of written leases.
 If, at the expiry of the lease, the lessee remains in possession of the
 property with the lessor's acquiescence, a new lease is formed under the
 conditions of an unwritten lease, unless specifically excluded by the initial
 agreement or by the contract's nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general rule for renewed contracts is that they continue under the same
 conditions as the original, except for certain clauses that may be considered
 divisible or specific to the initial term.
 Each renewal is treated as a new contract, allowing for adjustments and
 updates to reflect the parties' current circumstances and intentions.
 Notably, unless explicitly agreed otherwise, a renewed contract under Article
 1738 does not have a predetermined termination date, reinforcing the importance
 of specifying any desired changes or limitations during the renewal process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these rules are meant to protect the interests of the weaker party in
 contractual relationships, such as in rental agreements or employment contracts.
 By ensuring that renewals and terminations adhere to principles of fairness
 and reasonable notice, the law aims to maintain balanced and equitable
 agreements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Classification Depending on the Status of the Different Parties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
intuitu personae 
\emph default
(depending on the person) nature of certain contracts highlights the importance
 of personal considerations in the formation of agreements.
 In such contracts, the specific characteristics or qualifications of the
 parties involved are crucial, and a mistake regarding the identity or essential
 qualities of a party (
\emph on
erreur sur la personne
\emph default
) can be a reason for nullifying the agreement.
 However, the importance of personal considerations has diminished over
 time due to the growth and frequency of commercial exchanges, making it
 a less dominant factor in many contractual relationship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
The Status of 
\emph on
Consumer 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
Professional
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distinction between a consumer and a professional is objectively defined
 within consumer law, as demonstrated by the Cour de Cassation's decision
 on May 15, 1984, concerning a patient's relationship with a doctor.
 This distinction is pivotal in determining the applicability of specific
 protections and obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jurisprudence has further clarified this distinction, as seen in the case
 of May 3, 1998, where a priest purchasing a photocopier for parish use
 was not considered a professional act due to its linkage to the parish's
 activities.
 Conversely, acts directly related to professional activity are deemed 
\emph on
professional
\emph default
.
 This was adjusted from earlier jurisprudence, which considered professional
 acting outside their area of expertise as consumers, as in the case of
 May 25, 1992, regarding a reseller buying an alarm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Special rules apply to loans for consumers, where the object of the loan
 is a critical consideration.
 Since 1993, consumer rights have been codified, encompassing rules on advertisi
ng, information, cooling-off periods, and retraction, alongside mechanisms
 for control and enforcement against unfair terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The codification of consumer rights aims to balance interests and promote
 
\emph on
legal solidarism
\emph default
, though it also introduces some challenges.
 It disrupts traditional contract law principles, like consent, offer and
 acceptance, and can be seen as unstable, bureaucratic, formalistic, and
 rigid.
 Critics argue that the emphasis on consumer protection can hinder economic
 development by introducing additional costs and complexities.
 Special attention is given to adults incapable of managing their affairs
 independently, whose protection is considered very important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Classification Depending on the Mode of Formation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Consensual contracts
\series default
: these are based on the simple agreement of the parties involved.
 The essence of consensual contracts is that they are formed by the mutual
 consent of the parties regarding the contract's terms, without the need
 for any formalities or the transfer of a thing.
 This principle is foundational in French law, as highlighted in Article
 1172, which underscores the importance of consent in contract formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Real contracts
\series default
: real contracts require the transfer of a thing (an object or right) for
 the contract to be considered formed.
 Examples include loans (Article 1875), deposits (Article 1919), and pledges
 (Articles 2071).
 These contracts are not complete until the specified object has been transferre
d from one party to the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Solemn contracts
\series default
: solemn contracts require specific formalities to be fulfilled for the
 contract to be valid.
 These formalities could include written documentation, registration, or
 other legal procedures.
 The solemnity aspect underscores the contract's importance, ensuring clarity
 and legal compliance.
 For example, a real estate contract that requires a notarized deed to be
 legally valid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Negociated contracts
\series default
: these contracts are the results of back-and-forth negotiations between
 the parties, allowing for terms and conditions to be discussed and agreed
 upon before the contract is finalized.
 This type reflects a social reality where parties have equal bargaining
 power to shape the contract's content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Membership (adhesion) contracts
\series default
: membership contracts are standard form contracts where one party (typically
 a business or service provider) sets the contract terms, and the other
 party (usually a consumer) has little to no ability to negotiate.
 The consumer can aither accept the contract as is or reject it entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite the foundational role of Common Law principles in contracts, the
 issue of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

unfair terms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has gained prominence, addressing concerns over potential imbalances in
 membership contracts.
 This has led to specific regimes in some foreign legal systems to protect

Historical Review
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Roman contracts and non-contractual obligations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Roman legal system introduced the notion of contracts with four primary
 consensual contracts: sale, mandate, rental, and company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It also recognized non-contractual obligations such as guardianship and
 tort sources, expanding the scope of legal obligations beyond formal agreements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Evolution from individualism to opposing interests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 1804, the notion of contract was heavily individualistic, anchored in
 the theory of free will (
\emph on
autonomie de la volonté
\emph default
).
 Over time, legal theory has shifted towards considering 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

opposing interests
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, acknowledging the dynamic and often conflicting nature of contractual
 relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unilateral Deed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A unilateral deed, or unilateral declaration, involves a situation where
 a single party's declaration or promise creates an obligation upon them,
 without requiring acceptance or an act of performance by another party
 for it to take effect.
 The obligation is self-imposed by the declarant's will alone, and it must
 be communicated to the person it affects, but it does not form an agreement
 between two parties.
 For example, a promise to make a donation to charity can be considered
 a unilateral deed.
 If an individual publicly announces their intention to donate a certain
 amount to a charity, they have created an obligation for themselves through
 their declaration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A unilateral deed is distinguised from a unilateral contract by requiring
 only one party's will to create an obligation, while in a unilateral contract,
 the obligation is conditional upon the performance of a specified act by
 another party, essentially forming an agreement once the act is performed.
 However, for such a deed to be valid, the impacted individual must be informed,
 and there exists debate over the validity of self-imposed obligations.
 An example is a public promise to reimburse, which can be revoked until
 the promised act is accomplished.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-Mandatory Conventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Non-mandatory conventions, such as debt forgiveness, do not create obligations
 and are theoretically distinct from contracts, despite being effective
 in practice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example are acts of kindness and accommodation, which are actions
 taken out of goodwill or to accommodate someone else, such as providing
 a ride or assisting a third party withoyt expecting anything in return.
 Initially, these acts may not create legal obligations.
 However, if they lead to harm or loss, they could result in indemnity claims.
 Over time, such acts might be interpreted through a quasi-contractual lens,
 especially if they resemble actions typically covered by contracts, like
 providing services under a free services contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Gentleman's agreements
\series default
 are informal agreements based on the honor of the parties involved, rather
 than legal obligations.
 They are characterized by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Basis in honor
\series default
: the primary foundation of a gentlemna's agreement is the personal integrity
 and honor of the parties.
 Such agreements are common between states or friends, where formal contracts
 are either impractical or deemed innecessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Legal enforceability
\series default
: while the legal doctrine often views these agreements as non-binding due
 to the lack of legal obligations, courts sometimes consider the common
 intentions of the parties involved.
 If it appears that the parties intended to create a binding commitment,
 a court may enforce the agreement based on those intentions, despite the
 informal nature of the agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Letters of intent
\series default
 are documents used during the preliminary stages of negotitations to outline
 the key elements of a proposed agreement and the parties' intent to continue
 discussions.
 They serve several important functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Clarification of intentions
\series default
: they help both parties clarify their intentions and the main points of
 the deal under considetation, providing a roadmap for future negotiations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Non-binding nature
\series default
: typically, they are non-binding regarding the final agreement, meaning
 they do not legally obligate the parties to finalzie the deal.
 However, certain parts of a letter of intention, such as confidentiality
 clauses or exclusivity agreements, may be binding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Ambiguity and enforcement
\series default
: the notion of letter of intention is ambiguous because, while they signify
 a willingness to engage in negotiations, the extent to which they are enforceab
le varies.
 If a letter of intention is detailed and includes terms that suggest a
 commitment, courts may interpret it as binding, depending on the parties'
 apparent intent and the document's specific language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Avant-Contracts (Preliminary Contracts)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Avant-contracts are preliminary agreements that outline the terms and conditions
 under which the parties intend to enter into a definitive contract in the
 future.
 They are binding to the extent that they commit the parties to continue
 their negotiations based on the terms outlined in the avant-contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several types:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Unilateral promise to contract
\series default
: gives one party, the beneficiary, the option to enter into a contract
 within a specified time frame.
 This promise grants the beneficiary a personal right against the promisor,
 which becomes enforceable once the option is exercised.
 Before acceptance, it's a personal right; after acceptance, it transforms
 into an indefeasible right subject to forced execution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Synallagmatic promise
\series default
: involves mutual commitments from both parties to enter into a contract
 upon meeting certain conditions or formalities.
 This type of acant-contract is immediately binding as a promise of sale,
 effectively considered equivalent to a sale, as per Article 1589 of the
 Civil Code.
 However, the execution of the definitive contract may depend on completing
 specific formalities or conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Crossed promises
\series default
: consist of two unlitateral promises that intersect; for example, one party
 promises to sell, and the other promises to buy under the same conditions.
 This arrangement is treated as a synallagmatic promise and is equivalent
 to a sales contract, although this interpretation has faced criticism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Legal implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Contractual value of pre-contractual documents: even advertisements and
 pre-contractual documents can have contractual value, as seen in a 2004
 ruling by the Cour de Cassation.
 Misrepresentations in such documents can lead to liability for misconduct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No constraining value after contract conclusion: once the definitive contract
 is concluded, the pre-contractual documents lose their binding force under
 specifically incorporated into the final agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exceptions: there are exceptions where the promise of a contract does not
 equate to the contract itself, particularly in cases involving loans and
 where adamages are sought as a remedy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Reiteraiton and consent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reiteration, the act of repeating the contract formalization process, typically
 in front of a notary, can sometimes be replaced by a court decision.
 Parties may also choose to include reiteration as an element of their consent,
 further solidifying the agreement's binding nature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Formation of the Contract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formation of a contract is a fundamental concept in contract law that
 outlines the conditions under which agreements become legally binding between
 parties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Article 1103 of the Civil Code establishes that contracts, once legally
 constituted, are binding upon the parties involved, acting as their law.
 This principle underscores the autonomy and the binding nature of contracts,
 highlighting the importance of agreements being formed in compliance with
 legal standards.
 It specifies four essential requirements for a contract's validity:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Consent of the parties
\series default
: agreement must be made without coercion, mistake, or misrepresentation.
 Both parties must clearly and voluntarily agree to the contract terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Capacity to contract
\series default
: parties must have the legal ability to enter into a contract.
 This typically means they are of a certain age (usually 18 or older) and
 of sound mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Definite object
\series default
: the contract must have a clear subject matter or obejctive.
 This means the goods, services, or rights being exchanged are specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Lawful cause
\series default
: the purpose and terms of the contract must be legal and not against public
 policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notably, Article 1108 does not mandate a specific form for the contract,
 allowing for flexibility in how agreements are made, whether orally, in
 writing, or through conduct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Voluntary Agreements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formation process emphasizes the voluntary nature of agreements, detailing
 how parties should conduct negotiations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Discussions
\series default
: the initial stage involves discussions, which are not the same as making
 a firm offer.
 It's an invitation to negotiate, marking the start of potential contract
 formation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Invitation to start discussions
\series default
: this is distinct from a firm offer and serves as the initiation of negotiation
s, without committing either party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Freedom to end negotiations
\series default
: parties are free to withdraw from talks at any time before an agreement
 is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Obligations of good faith
\series default
: throughout the discussions, parties are expected to engage honestly and
 fairly, avoiding misleading or deceitful practices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Informing and cooling off period
\series default
: parties should inform each other about the terms and conditions of the
 proposed agreement.
 A cooling-off period may be allowed, giving parties time to reconsider
 their commitment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Effort to reach an agreement
\series default
: negotiations should aim to conclude with a mutual agreement, avoiding
 unnecessary delays or extensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Confidentiality
\series default
: respect for sensitive information shared during negotiations is crucial.
 Confidential details whould not be disclosed without consent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Limited tort liability
\series default
: while parties may be held liable for certain costs incurred during the
 negotiation phase, such as preliminary studies, they generally cannot be
 held responsible for the loss of an opportunity that never materialzied
 into a contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example of consent: two businesses agreeing to terms for a supply of goods
 after negotiations, where both parties clearly accept the terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example of capacity: an adult entering into a lease agreement for an apartment,
 having the legal age and mental ability to do so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example of definitive object: a contract for the sale of a car, where the
 make, model, and year of the car are specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Example of lawful cause: a service contract for landscaping work, where
 the services to be provided are legal and have a legitimate purpose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Pollicitation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Pollicitation refers to the act of making an offer in the context of contract
 formation.
 It is a key step in initiating contractual negotiations, setting out the
 terms under which the offeror is willing to enter into a contract.
 Let's break down the essential characteristics of a pollicitation and provide
 some clarity on its implications:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Firmness
\series default
: an offer must be firm, indicating the offeror's clear intention to be
 bound by the offer if accepted by the offeree.
 This means the offeror cannot withdraw the offer arbitrarily before the
 specified time period for acceptance has elapse or, if no time is specified,
 within a reasonable period.
 For example, a car dealership places an advertisement offering a specific
 model at a stated price, indicated the offer is valid until the end of
 the month.
 This is a firm offer because the dealership commits to the terms provided
 until the specified expiration date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Precision
\series default
: the offer must be precise, containing all the essential elements of the
 contract, notably the price.
 This precision ensures that, upon acceptance, there is a clear agreement
 on the contract's fundamental terms without the need for further negotiation.
 For example, an online retailer lists a product with a detailed description
 and price, making it clear what is being offered for sale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Express nature
\series default
: pollicitation must always be express, regardless of its form.
 It can be communicated in various ways, including written, oral, or even
 through conduct, such as displaying goods for sale in a public space.
 The key is that the offer must unambiguously indicate the offeror's intention
 to be bound.
 For example, a company sends a proposal to provide IT services to another
 business, detailing the scope of services and associated costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Public offer
\series default
: a public offer, one made to an unspecified audience, holds the same legal
 weight as an offer directed at a specific individual.
 The first party to accept such an offer in accordance with its terms effectivel
y enters into a contract with the offeror.
 For example, a restaurant displaying a sign outside offering a lunch special
 at a specific price.
 This is binding on the restaurant for anyone who enters and orders the
 special, fulfilling the conditions of the offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reservations
\series default
: to mitigate the strictness of this rule, an offer can include certain
 reservations.
 For instance, the 
\emph on
intuitu peersonae
\emph default
 principle allows the offeror to stipulate that the acceptance must come
 from a party possessing specific qualities or qualifications deemed necessary
 for the contract's purpose.
 For example, a job posting requires applicants to have certain qualifications
 or experience, indicating that only those who meet these criteria are eligible
 to accept the offer of employment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Period of time
\series default
: an offer also includes a time frame for acceptance, which can be explicit
 or implicit, repending on the contract's nature or intended to be resonable.
 This period defines how long the offer remains open for acceptance, after
 which it may expire if not accepted.
 For example, the car sale previously mention.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Regime Governing the Offer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regime governing the offer outlines the conditions under which an offer
 can be made, modified, or withdrawn, and the consequences of these actions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Retraction of the offer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, an offer is revocable, meaning the offeror can withdraw it before
 it is accepted.
 However, an offer becomes irrevocable if the offeror explicitly states
 the intention to not withdraw the offer for a certain period or under specific
 conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the offeror retracts an irrevocable offer, they may be liable for breach
 of the promise not to revoke the offer.
 This could lead to claims for damages by the offeree or enforcement of
 a penalty clause, if one was included in the offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the offeror retracts the offer during the period it was supposed to remain
 open (or before the offeree has had a reasonable time to consider it, in
 the absence of a specified period), this action constitutes a fault.
 If the cancellation causes damages to the offeree, the offeror may be held
 liable under tort responsibility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Public offers: the offeror can freely revoke a public offer unless it has
 been accepted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Specific person: if the offer targets a specific person, the offeror must
 allow a reasonable period for the offeree to examine and consider the offer
 before revocation, as established in a 2005 decision by the Cour de cassation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lapse of termination of the offer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An offer becomes 
\series bold
obsolete
\series default
, meaning it stops producing effects, under certain conditions, such as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The death of the offeror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The offeror undergoing bankruptcy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sudden incapacity of the offeror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the offeree initially refuses the offer but then rapidly changes their
 mind, the initial refusal typically terminates the offer.
 However, the legal implications can vary based on the specifics of the
 situation and the timing of the change of mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jurisprudence is not clear regarding the effect of the offeror'sdeath within
 the specified time period for acceptance.
 Generally, unless the offer is of a personal nature or the contract specifies
 otherwise, the death of the offeror does not automatically revoke the offer
 before its expiration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Acceptance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acceptance is a crucial step in the formation of a contract, indicating
 the offeree's agreement to the terms proposed by the offeror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Enlightened (Wise) acceptance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For acceptance to be valid, it must be informed.
 The offeree is presumed to be aware of and understand all clauses that
 are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

readable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

usual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 within the context of the agreement.
 Clauses that fall outside of what's considered a tacit agreement are not
 deemed accepted unless proven otherwise.
 This ensures that acceptance is based on a full understanding of the terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a person signing a lease agreement is presumed to understand
 and accept all standard clauses that are clearly presented and typical
 for such agreements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Pure and simple
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acceptance must be unconditional and unambiguous.
 If the acceptance alters any terms of the offer, it is not considered a
 true acceptance but a counter-offer, which effectively nullifies the original
 offer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Tacit acceptance
\series default
: can be inferred from the actions of the parties, indicating agreement
 to the contract terms through conduct rather than explicit verbal or wirtten
 confirmation.
 For example, using a product or service without objection after receiving
 it can be interpreted as tacit acceptance of the sale terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Silence as acceptance
\series default
: generally, silence is not considered acceptance.
 This principle is particularly emphasized in consumer law to prevent practices
 such as forced sales at a distance.
 An exception exists when silence can be contextualized, such as in ongoing
 business relationships, or specific legal texts allow for it, or a letter
 confirms a previous verbal agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Contracts Between Absents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contracts between absents refer to agreements made when the offeror and
 offeree are not physically present together, often facilitated through
 communication technologies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
emission/reception theory
\series default
 addresses how and when a contract is formed between absent parties.
 The focus is on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Emission theory
\series default
: a contract is considered formed when the offeror sends the acceptance,
 regardless of whether the offeree has received it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Reception theory
\series default
: a contract is only formed when the acceptance is received by the offeror.
 This approach is more common and practical, ensuring that the offeror is
 aware of the acceptance before being bound by it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if a freelancer sends an email accepting a project offer and
 the terms are received and acknowledged by the client, the contract is
 formed under the reception theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Practical implications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Jurisdiction
\series default
: the location where the contract is considered completed can affect legal
 jurisdiction, which is important for determining the applicable laws and
 where legal actions can be initiated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Revocation of the offer
\series default
: challenges arise when an offer is revoked after acceptance has been sent
 but before it is received.
 The lack of clear jurisprudence on this matter requires judges to interpret
 the intent of the parties to determine if a contract was effectively formed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Electronic Contracts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The French Law on Confidence in the Digital Economy (LCEN), dated June 4,
 2004, and its subsequent modification on June 16, 2005, to transpose a
 European Directive from June 8, 2000, provide a regulatory framework for
 electronic contracts.
 These regulations are encapsulated within Articles 1369-1 to 1369-3 (and
 beyond) of the French Civil Code.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Electronic contracts
\series default
 are agreements where at least one party offers goods or services through
 electronic means, typically via the internet.
 This definition includes a broad range of commercial transactions conducted
 online, from e-commerce sales to service agreements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Key provisions and requirements
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Article 1369-1: offer and technical conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The offer in an electronic contract must clearly detail the contractual
 terms and various technical conditions pertinent to digital transactions.
 These include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Contractual conditions: detailed description of goods or services, pricing,
 and terms of use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Technical conditions: steps for contract conclusion, mechanisms for identifying
 and correcting errors before submission, language of the contract, and
 rules regarding the archiving of contracts and commercial regulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Steps for contract conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law specifies that clear instructions must be provided on how to proceed
 through the different stages of entering into the contract.
 This ensures transparency and understanding for users navigating the contract
 formation process online.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Correction of errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There must be be technical means available for users to identify and correct
 any errors in their inputs before the final submission of their agreement.
 This feature is crucial for preventing misunderstandings or unintentional
 commitments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Contract language and archives
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Specifications regarding the language used in the contract and how the contracts
 are archived offer additional clarity and security for both parties involved
 in the electronic transaction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Professional and commercial rules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The offer must also include any relevant professional or commercial rules,

\begin_layout Standard
The acceptance of electronic contracts follows the general principles of
 contract law, requiring a clear and unequivocal agreement to the terms
 proposed by the offeror.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
double click rule
\series default
, introduced in Article 1369-4, emphasizes the need for explicit confirmation
 of acceptance.
 Typically, this involves a process where the user must click once to select
 an option and again to confirm their choice, ensuring a deliberate and
 informed agreement to the contract terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the purposes of evidence and certainty, and order, its acceptance, and
 the acknowledgment of receipt are considered received when they can be
 accesses by the intended recipients.
 This provisions addresses the unique aspect of electronic communication,
 where access equates to receipt.
 Article 1369-5.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an online retailer's checkout process that requires customers

\begin_layout Subsection
Defects in Consent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Defects in consent are critical considerations in contract law that can
 affect the validity of a contract.
 These defects arise when the agreement between parties is influenced by
 factors that compromise the free and informed consent of one or more parties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Preliminary Remarks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a contract to be valid, it must meet four fundamental conditions (Article
 1108):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Consent of the obliging party
\series default
: the party agreeing to the contract must do so willingly and knowingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Capacity to contract
\series default
: parties must have the legal ability to enter into a contract, typically
 involving agre and mental competence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Definite object
\series default
: the contract must have a clear subject matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Lawful cause
\series default
: the purpose of the contract must be elgal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consent is considered valid only if it is given freely and without any defects.
 If consent is flawed, the contract may be deemed void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain individuals, such as those who are incapable (due to mental incapacity),
 dying persons, or illiterate individuals, may lack the ability to give
 valid consent.
 Originally, the concern oveer consent was particularly relevant to gifts
 but has been extended to all acts requiring legal capacity, as highlighted
 by Article 489, which states the necessity of being of sound mind to engage
 in valid legal acts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Objectives of protection and contractual security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law aims to balance the protection of individuals with the need for
 contractual security.
 This includes safeguarding against 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lésion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
, where there's a significant imbalance between the obligations of the parties
 involved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consent is not considered valid if it is affected by any of the following
 defects (Article 1109):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Mistake
\series default
: an error by one or more parties about a fundamental aspect of the contract.
 For example, a person buys a painting believing it to be an original work
 of a famous artist, but it turns out to be a false copy.
 The mistake about a fundamental aspect of the contract (the painting's
 authenticity) could nullify the agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Dol
\series default
: deception by one party to induce another to enter into the contract.
 For example, if a seller knowingly misrepresents a car's condition to a
 buyer, and the buyer relies on this misinformation when agreeing to the
 purchase, the contract could be voided due to fraud.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Violence
\series default
: coercion or undue pressure exerted on a party to force them into the contract.
 For example, threatening someone to sign a contract under threat of harm
 constitutes duress.
 Contracts signed under such conditions are voidable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Mistake
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
mistake
\series default
 occurs when one or both parties hold an incorrect belief about a critical
 fact at the time of contract formation.
 It is a commong ground for disputing the validity of a contract, because
 it indicates that the parties may not have reached a genuine agreement
 due to the error.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Distinguishing between a mistake and a guarantee against hidden effects
 is crucial.
 A mistake pertains to an error in understanding or belief at the time of
 agreement, while a 
\series bold
guarantee against hidden effects
\series default
 deals with undisclosed flaws in the subject matter, that were not known
 at the time of sale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several types of mistake:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Mistake on the Substance 
\series default
(Article 1133):
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\bar under
Objective and subjective evaluation
\bar default
: initially, the substance of a mistake was viewed objectively, focusing
 on whether a reasonable person would find the error significant.
 Over time, the assessment has become more subjective, considering whether
 the mistaken fact was a substantial quality important to the contracting
 party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\bar under
Concrete VS Abstract Evaluation
\bar default
: the debate centers on whether the significance of the mistake should be
 evaluated in the specific context of the contract (
\emph on
in concreto
\emph default
) or based on general standards (
\emph on
in abstracto
\emph default
), affecting the burden of the proof.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A notable case is 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Le Verrou

\end_inset

 
\emph default
case from March 24, 1987.
 In this case, the controversy involved the sale of an artwork attributed
 to Fragonard.
 The court ruled that the parties ahd accepted the risk of the painting's
 authenticity, and the heirs failed to prove that the seller has consented
 to the sale under a mistaken belief.
 This illustrates the complexity of proving a mistake in contracts involving
 art, where authenticity may be uncertain.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The obstacle mistake
\series default
: this refers to a fundamental misunderstanding where there is no true meeting
 of minds, often relating to the contract's object.
 It requires clarification or can lead to contract annulment if the mistake
 is about a central aspect of the agreement.
\end_layout

 case.
 In this case, an amateur auctioned a painting believed to be by Poussin,
 a belief based on family tradition.
 However, after the Louvre won the auction and declared it a Poussin, the
 attribution was contested.
 This case highlights mistakes regarding the provision or attribution of
 an artwork, affecting the contract's validity.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Irrelevant mistake
\series default
: mistakes about a party's motivation or the value of the contract subject
 are generally deemed irrelevant, as they do not pertain to the contract's
 substance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle 
\emph on

de non vigilantibus non curat praetor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 (the law does not protect those who are not vigilant) applies here, indicating
 that the law does not remedy mistakes due to a lack of diligence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The material mistake does not lead ot the annulment but has to be modified.
 This modification could be refused if it creates a prejudice and the victim
 has good faith.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Dol
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Dol
\series default
 refers to fraudulent behavior or deceit employed by one party to induce
 another to enter into a contract.
 Dol has characteristics of both a criminal offense, fue to the deceitful
 intent, and a civil one, as it pertains to the breach of contractual obligation
s.
 The modern perspective focuses on the vistim's experience, emphasizing
 the deceit's impact on their consent to the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The criteria for dol are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Intentional deceit
\series default
: dol is considered a cause for annulment of a contract when one party uses
 tactics so deceptive that it's evident the other party would not have consented
 without such deceit.
 This requires the victim to prove the presence of dol, as it is not presumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Dishonest tactics
\series default
: the essence of dol lies in the use of dishonest tactics, including lies
 or significant omissions, to mislead the other party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Silence as dol (
\emph on
réticence dolosive
\emph default
)
\series default
: deliberately withholding crucial information that one has a duty to disclose
 can constitute dol.
 This is particularly the case when the omission manipulates the other party
 into entering the contract under false pretenses (Article 1139).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some examples and jurisprudence are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lies and exaggerations: while mere puffery or sales talk may not always
 constitute dol, outright lies or strategic omissions designed to deceive
 do.
 For instance, the case from the Cour de Cassation November 6, 1970, highlighted
 that even lies without accompanying actions could constitute dol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Employment applications: jurisprudence tends to be lenient towards misrepresenta
tions made by job applicants unless they significantly impact the employment
 decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The determining factos and exceptions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Determinant for consent: dol must be a determining factor in the victim's
 consent; otherwise, the remedy may be limited to damages rather than annulment
 of the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Proof of intention: proving dol requires showing intentional deceit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Source of dol: usually, dol originates from the other contractual party,
 but exceptions exist, such as in cases of fraudulent collusion or when
 dol is based on a unilateral document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The practical implications of dol can be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Annulment and damages: if dol is proven, it can lead to the annulment of
 the contract, or in less clear-cut cases, victims may be entitled to damages
 for the deceit suffered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Responsibility to disclose: parties to a contract have a fundamental obligation
 to be honest and forthcoming about critical information related to the
 agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Violence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Violence addresses situations where consent to a contract is obtained through
 undue pressure, whether physical, psychological, or economic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The legal basis of violence are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Article 1111: this article establishes that violence, whether exerted by
 a party to the contract or a third party for their benefit, is a valid
 cause for annulment of the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Article 1112: defines violence as acts that would intimidate a reasonable
 person, causing fear of exposing oneself or one's property to significant
 and immediate danger.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristics and scope of violence are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Rarity
\series default
: it's less commonly invoked than mistake and dol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Source and means
\series default
: the origin of the violence and the methods used are immaterial to its
 validity as a cause for annulment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Exploiting weakness
\series default
: modern interpretations include exploting a party's weakness that leads
 to a significant mistake as a form of violence.
 For example, a case where an individual, knowing another person's desperate
 financial situation, offers a loan on extremely unfavorable terms.
 The lender exploits the borrower's vulnerability, which could be considered
 a form of violenve if it led to the borrower's consent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Exclusions
\series default
: mere reverential fear, where respects or deference to another causes one
 to agree, does not constitute violence for the purpose of annulment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Economic violence
\series default
: since 2002, the concept has expanded to include economic violence, where
 undue advantage is taken of another's economic dependence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions for violence are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Determinant
\series default
: the violence must be a determining factor in the aggrieved party's decision
 to enter into the contract, assessed on a case-by-case basis (
\emph on
in concreto
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Human action
\series default
: violence must emanate from an action or threat by another person, directly
 or indirectly affecting the contract party.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Exceptional adjustments
\series default
: in specific situations, such as some maritime rescues, the agreement might
 be adjusted rather than annulled to reflect the circumstances.
 For example, imagine your boat breaks in the sea, and another boat passes
 by.
 They offer to rescue you for 1M€, and at the moment you accept.
 However, once you are in land, you think they took advantage of your desperate
 position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Lesion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lesion refers to a situation where there is a significant imbalance between
 the performances of the parties involved in a contract, to the detriment
 of one party.
 Unlike classical defects in consent, lesion is considered a special cause
 for the annulment or adjustment of a contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Article 1118 specifies that the lesion vitiates contracts only under certain
 conditions, applicable to specific contracts or certain categories of people.
 It suggests that the principle of freedom of contract is paramount, but
 exceptions exist to protect parties from grossly unfair agreements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The characteristics of the lesion are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Not a general vice
\series default
: it's not recognized as a general ground for annulment across all contracts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Security of contract principle
\series default
: underscores the importance of respecting agreements and ensuring that
 contracts are respected as binding obligations.
 Lesion is an exception to this principle, introduced to prevent exploitation
 and ensure fairness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Applicability
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Incapables: are protected against lesion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sales or real estate: transactions involving real estate may be scrutinized
 for lesion, given the significant value and potential for exploitation.
 For example if a person, taking advantage of another's urgent need for
 money, purchases their property at a price significantly below market value,
 this could be challenged as lesion, especially if the seller is considered
 incapable of fully understanding the transaction's implication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Shares and other securities: deals involving shares, stocks, or other financial
 instruments may also be subject to review for lesion.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The courts have granted themselves the authority to adjust the remunerations
 of mandatory and liberal professions if they are deemed to involve lesion.
 For example, if a doctor charges a fee that is exorbitantly high compared
 to the standard rates for their services, and especially if the client
 is in a vulnerable position, the courts may decide to reduce the fee on
 the ground of lesion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Protective Legislation of the Consumer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protective legislation for consumers is a critical component of modern
 legal systems, particularly in response to the complexities of a consumption-dr
iven society.
 These laws aim to correct the imbalances between consumers and businesses
 by enrusing trasparency, fairness, and informed consent in transactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Businesses are obliged to inform their clients, and this has three branches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Commercial advertisement
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
False advertising
\series default
: any commercial advertisement found to be false is subject to sanctions.
 This protects consumers from being misled about the quality, nature, or
 price of goods and services.
 For example, a company advertises a weight loss supllement with unfounded
 claims about its effectiveness.
 Upon investigation, these claims are found to be false, leading to sanctions
 against the company.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Comparative publicity
\series default
: allowed since 1992, provided it is fair and honers, comparative advertising
 helps consumer make informed decisions by comparing the attributes of different
 products or services.
 For example, an electronic retailer publishes an ad comparing the specification
s and prices of laptops from different manufacturers.
 The comparison is factual and helps consumers make informed choices, so
 it is permitted.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Information on the product
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Mandatory disclosures
\series default

 manual mentions, which ensure that consumers have access to essential informait
on about what they are purchasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Neiertz law generalization
\series default
: this law mandates that every professional seller of goods or service provider
 must, before concluding a transaction, enable the consumer to understand
 the main characteristics of the good or service.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Personalized information
\series default
: this aspect is often emphasized by jurisprudence, requiring professional
 sellers to inform, advise, or recommend based on their duty towards the
 consumer.
 This personalized information helps consumers make choices that are best
 suited to their specific needs and circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Repent Cooling Off Withdraw
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective is to reinforce the consumer's consent by providing a cooling-off
 period.
 This period allows consumers to reconsider their purchase decisions without
 pressure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right of cooling off are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
L121-6
\series default
: regulates any money given as a guarantee or payment during the cooling-off
 period.
 This provisions ensures that consumers can back out a transaction without
 financial penalty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Anticipation and preservation
\series default
: the law provides for the anticipaiton of a cooling-off period or the preservat
ion of a withdrawal right in specific transactions, such as distant sales
 or financial services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a consumer purchases a smartphone online and then decides it
 does not meet their needs.
 Thanks to the cooling-off period, they can return the phone within a specified
 timeframe for a full refund without needing to provide a reason.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Object and Cause
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concepts of object and cause are central to understanding the validity
 and enforceability of contracts under the French Civil Code.
 These elements ensure that a contract is formed based on clear, lawful,
 and achievable terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Object of the Obligation or Object of the Contract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
object
\series default
 refers to the subject matter of the agreement or obligation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
object of the obligation
\series default
 refers specically to the performance that is due from the obligor to the
 obligee.
 This performance can be an action or an omission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
object of the contract
\series default
 encompasses the broader subject matter of the contract itseld, including
 all the rights and obligations that the contract creates for the parties
 involved.
 It is more comprehensive than the object of the obligation, as it considers
 the overall purpose and scope of the agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Civil Code addresses both notions.
 While the doctrine emphasizes the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

object of the obligation
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\emph default
 as the primary valid notion (Article 1129), references to the

\end_inset

object of the contract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 are found in Articles 1110, 1128 and 220, among others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, in a contract for the sale of a house:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Object of the obligation: for the seller, it's to transfer ownership of
 the house to the buyer and ensure the property is as agreed.
 For the buyer, it's to pay the agreed price to the seller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Object of the contract: the broader agreement that encompasses not only
 the transfer of property and payment, but any additional terms such as
 the timeline for the transfer, conditions for inspection, obligations for
 repairs, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions for the object are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Existence
\series default
: the object must exist at the time of the contract, or at least its future
 existence is anticipated, making it valid for contracts involving future
 goods (Article 1130).
 An example is an agreement to purchase crops that are yet to be harvested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Determined or determinable
\series default
: the specific items doesn't need to be identified at the contract's formation
 but must be identifiable in the future.
 For example, a contract for the delivery of 100 tons of wheat from the
 enxt harvest meets this condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Possible
\series default
: the object must be physically and legally possible to deliver.
 For example, a contract to sell a piece of land on the moon would be considered
 impossible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Licit
\series default
: the object must be legal and not violate public policy or legal norms.
 For example, selling prohibited substances would constitute an illicit
 object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some restrictions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Future successions and work
\series default
: the law prohibits contracts based purely on speculative future successions
 or the global assignment of future work, ensuring contracts are based on
 concrete, definable object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Price fixing and distribution framework agreements
\series default
: the Civil Code clarifies that while the determination of goods is essential,
 price-fixing within distribution agreements does not pertain to the object
 itself but to the terms of the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Cause

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
cause
\series default
 refers to the underlying reason or purpose behind entering into an agreement.
 It represents the legal and motivational basis for the obligations that
 parties undertake through the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In classical analysis, the cause is seen as the counterpart for each party's
 obligation, analyzed objectively to determine its legality and existence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cause must persist throughout the duration of the contract.
 If the underlying cause of one party's obligation ceases to exist, the
 principle of reciprocity may be compromised, potentially leading to the
 contract's resolution for non-performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the modern conception, the existence of the cause is considered from
 an objective standpoint, separate from the parties' subjective motivations,
 yet crucial for the contract's validity.
 The cause must be lawful, meaning it cannot contravene legal norms or public
 policy.
 The assessment of whether a cause is licit involves considering the parties'
 intentions and the contract's circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if the primary motivation for entering a contract is smuggling
 goods, the cause is deemed illicit, rendering the contract void.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
false cause
\series default
 occurs when a party is mistaken about the existence of a counterpart or
 benefit.
 For instance, entering a contract believing it grants exclusive rights
 to a product, only to find out such exclusivity doesn't exist, could constitute
 a false cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Function of the Cause
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Legal requirement for effectiveness
\series default
: an obligation without a cause, based on a false cause, or founded on an
 illicit one, is ineffective.
 The typical remedy for contracts lacking a valid cause is relative annulment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Judge's role
\series default
: the absense or inadequacy of a cause is subject to judicial review, ensuring
 that contracts are founded on legitimate bases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Special consideration for aleatory contracts
\series default
: in contracts dependent on chance, the cause relates to the risk or chance
 of an event occurring, which constitutes the aagreement's basis.
 For example, in an insurance contract, the cause is the risk or chance
 involved.
 Participants enter these contracts accepting the uncertainty of outcomes
 as the cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Chronopost case
\series default
: this case highlighted the judiciary's power to nullify clauses that eliminate
 a contract's fundamental obligation, demonstrating how the cause, or its
 violation, affects contractual obligations.
 Chronopost offered express delivery services.
 The company had contractsthat included clauses limiting its liability for
 delays in delivery.
 These clauses essentially exempted Chronopost from significant responsibility
 if it failed to meet its express delivery guarantees.
 The central issue was whether the limitation of liability clauses were
 enforceable, especially when the company failed to meet its guaranteed
 delivery times.
 The case reached the Cour de cassation, which held that the limitation
 of liability clauses were not enforceable to the extent that they nullified
 the essential obligation of the contract, which was timely delivery.
 The court reasoned that the main cause of the contract from the customers'
 perspective was the guarantee of express delivery.
 If Chronopost could limit its liability for not fulfilling this essential
 obligation, it would undermine the very purpose for which customers entered
 into the contracts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Proof of the Cause
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The necessity to prove the existence of a cause is particularly emphasized
 for unilateral contracts with a financial basis, such as debt acknowledgments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Article 1132 of the Civil Code articulates that a contract remains valid
 even if the cause if not explicitly stated within the document.
 The obligation is presumed to be for a licit cause, and the burden of prood
 rests with the obligation holder to demonstrate this if challenged.
 However, if there is a claim that the cause is illicit, the proof can be
 provided by any means available, reflecting the flexibility in challenging
 the presumed legality of the cause.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Good Faith
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Civil Code underscores the principle of good faith in the execution
 of contracts.
 The Article 1134, paragraph 3, states that contracts must be executed in
 good faith, aiming to ensure economic predictability and fairness in contractua
l relationships.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objectives and implications of good faith are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Economic predictability
\series default
: good faith execution supports the stability and reliability of commercial
 transactions by ensuring that contracts are carried out according to their
 agreed terms and spirit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Adaptation to circumstances
\series default
: the principle may require parties to adjust the terms of a contract in
 response to unforeseen circumstances, facilitating the contract's continuity
 and preserving the parties' relationship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sanctions for breaching good faith can be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Forced termination
\series default
: a contract may be terminated if one party violates the principle of good
 faith, undermining the contract's foundation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Forced continuation
\series default
: conversely, a court may mandate a continuation of a contract, possibly
 under adjusted terms, to rectify a breach of good faith.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Relationship to abuse of right theory
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principle of good faith is closely related to the theory of abuse of
 rights, where exercising one's contractual rights in a manner intended
 to harm the other party or in a way that is beyond the contract's purpose
 can be sanctioned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Motivation control and limits
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While good faith imposes behavioral standards on contractual parties, it
 also respects the autonomy of the contract, implying that not all motivations
 or actions can be controlled or penalized under this principle.
 The application of good faith is contextual, considering the specifics
 of each case and the extent to which actions deviate from accepted standards
 of fairness and honesty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contractual Responsibility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Contractual responsibility
\series default
 is a fundamental concept that outlines the conditions under which a party
 may be held liable for failing to fulfill contractual obligations, This
 responsibility is determined by the nature of the obligations, the occurrence
 of damage, and the presence of fault.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Tort responsibility
\series default
 arises from damages caused by actions not bound by a contract, whereas
 contractual responsibility pertains to the failure to meet the obligations
 specified within a contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The elements of contractual responsibility are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Damage
\series default
: there must be a recognizable damage that is certain, direct, personal
 and foreseeable.
 This damage must result from the failure to fulfill a contractual obligation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Fault
\series default
: this involves the failrue to meet the agree standards or outcomes specified
 in the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Obligations as to Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an oblifations as to results, the focus is on achieving a specific outcome
 promised in the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fault: here, the fault is equated with the mere absence of the expected
 results, without needing to delve into the diligence or efforts of the
 debtor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Causes of exemption: the party bound by this obligation can be exempted
 from responsibility if they can prove that the failure was due to force
 majeure, a third-party action beyond their control, or the responsibility
 of the victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exception to the exception: even with these potential exemptions, certain
 guarantees may obligate the debtor regardless of these causes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a courier company promises to deliver a package by a certain
 date.
 If the package is not delivered on time, the company is in fault due to
 the non-achivement of the specified result, unless it can prove an exemption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Obligations of Means
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The debtor promises to exert all possible efforts and employ the necessary
 means to achieve a certain goal, but the specific result cannot be guaranteed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Evidence: the focus shifts to whether there was a failure to exercise the
 requisite level of care or effort.
 Establishing fault requires proving a breach in the standard of care or
 diligence expected under the circumstances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Appreciation of infringement: the assessment of whether the efforts were
 sufficient is generally more subjective and depends on the context of the
 obligation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a doctor treating a patient cannot guarantee recovery but is
 expected to provide competent and diligent medical care.
 Fault would be established if the doctor failed to provide the standard
 of care expected of a professional in similar circumstances
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Relativity of Notions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concept emphasizes the variability and context-dependency of obligations
 within contracts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Educational aspect: the relativity of notions serves as an educational tool
 in contract law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiplicity of obligations: each contract can contain a wide range of obligatio
ns, each with its own characteristics and requirements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Nature and degree: the nature of any given obligation often exists on a
 spectrum, with the specific details of the obligation and its enforcement
 being matters of degree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Uncertainty: the uncertain character of the notion points to the inherent
 ambiguities that can arise in interpreting and applying contractual obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ineffectiveness in international contracts: the principle of the relativity
 of notions may have limited applicability in international contracts, where
 differing legal systems and cultural understanding can affect the interpretatio
n and enforcement of obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Criterion of hazard: in some context, the concept of hazard (risk or chance)
 can serve as a criterion for determining the nature and extent of contractual
 obligations, especially in aleatory contracts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Peculiar Attention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For contractual parties, it is crucial to precisely define their obligations
 to ensure clarity and enforceability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Define the mission: clearly articulating the objectives and scope of the
 contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Time constraints: establishing deadlines and schedules for the performance
 of obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Means involved: specifying the resources and methods to be used in fulfulling
 the contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Limiting liability: incorporating lcauses that limit liability under certain
 conditions can help manage risk, but must be carefully crafted to avoid
 undermining the contract's essential obligations, as highlighted in the
 Chronopost case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Fault
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Article 1150 of the Civil Code outlines the principle that a debtor
 is only liable for damages that were foreseen or could have been foreseen
 at the time the contract was made, unless the failure to execute the obligation
 was due to their fraud (dol).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Dolosive fault
\series default
 refers to intentional misconduct or fraud in the non-fulfillment of an
 obligation.
 It goes beyond mere negligence, indicating a deliberate intent to cause
 harm or not to perform a contractual duty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a fault is dolosive, any contractual limitations on liability are rendered
 inapplicable, allowing for claims exceeding the initially foreseeable damages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding jurisprudence, courts have nuanced the requirements for an intention
 to harm, recognizing that extremely grave behavior or gross negligence
 can be assimilated with dolosive fault, thus extending the scope of the
 liability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a contractor deliberately uses substandard materials in a construct
ion project, knowing it will result in future structural failures, despite
 contractual specifications for higher quality materials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Les Causes d'Exonération
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
fource majeure
\series default
 is an unforeseeable, external, and irresistible occurrence that prevents
 the fulfillment of contractual obligations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parties can modify the application of force majeure within their contract,
 adjusting the standard for what constitutes such an event.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a natural disaster that destroy's a supplier's warehouse, making
 it impossible to deliver goods on time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
La Clause Pénale
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\series bold
penalty clause
\series default
 contractual determines the damages for breach of contract, typically setting
 the compensation above the actual loss to deter non-performance.
 The predetermined compensation applies regardless of whether actual harm
 occurs, simplifying the process of claiming damages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Courts retain the power to adjust the penalty if it is deemed excessively
 burdensome or unjust, ensuring fairness in its application.
 Some jurisdictions impose legal limits on the application or enforceability
 of penalty clauses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a penalty clause may stipulate that for every day of delay
 beyond the agreed date, the seller will pay a fixed amount to the buyer
 as compensation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Quasi-Contracts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
quasi-contract
\series default
 occurs when a person, the manager, voluntarily takes charge of another
 person's affairs without their authorization.
 The manager is expected to manage these affairs with the diligence of a
 reasonable person (
\emph on
bon père de famille
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The master of the affair is obliged to fulfill the commitments made by the
 manager in the course of managing the affairs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quasi-contract of gestion d'affaires requires that the master was not
 initially involved in the business, and the manager intended to manage
 the affairs on behalf of the master, eprforming management actions in their
 interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, if a person notices that their neighbor's house is on fire
 while the neighbor is away and calls the fire department, incurring expenses,
 the neighbor is expected to reimburse those expenses, recognizing the actions
 taken in their interest without prior agreement.

\begin_layout Section
Intellectual Property
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intellectual property law is designed to protect creators' rights to their
 works, balancing the interests of authors, intermediaries, and the public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Origins and Historical Background
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intellectual property law has evolved significantly over time, tracing back
 to the Renaissance when the first copyright laws emerged to protect authors
 and inventors.
 The development of IP law reflects the changing societal views on creativity,
 innovation, and the dissemination of knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theoretical foundations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core of IP law lies in recognizing and safeguarding the intellectual
 and creative labor of individuals, ensuring they can control and benefit
 from their creations.
 This legal framework seeks to stimulate crativity and innovation, while
 ensuring that the public can access and build upon existing works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Substantive Law
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Act of March 11, 1957 marked a shift towards a more industrial viewpoint
 of intellectual property, emphasizing the need for robust legal protection
 of creations without fundamentally altering the nature of copyright law.
 Its goals were to enhance legal protection, facilitate the dissemination
 of works, and streamline the consultation process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Acr of July 3, 1985 introduced the codification of IP laws, organizing
 and clarifying the rules to make them more accessible and systematic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protected Works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be protected under IP law, according to Article L.
 111-1 of the French IP Code, works must be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Original
\series default
: the work has the personal stamp of its creator, reflecting their choices
 and personality.
 This principle applies across different forms of IP, including copyright
 and patent law, where the focus is on the uniqueness of the expression
 or invention rather than the novelty or utility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Materialized
\series default
: it needs to be physically done.
 Ideas are not protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Originality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originality is not explicitly defined but is understood as the unique expression
 of the creator's personality in the work.
 Article L.
 112-1 emphasizes that protection covers all intellectual works, regardless
 of their form, merit, or purpose, as long as they reflect the author's
 personal contribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concept is 
\series bold
flexible
\series default
, allowing for a broad interpretation of what contributes a protectable
 work.
 This flexibility extends to adaptations of pre-existing works, which can
 be considered original if they sufficiently reflect the author's personal
 creativity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, Marcel Duchamp's works, such as his readymades, challenge tradition
al notions of originality and creativity.
 By selecting everyday objects and presenting them as art, Duchamp's contributio
ns lie in the idea and conceptual shift rather than in traditional artistic
 craftmanship.
 This raises interesting questions about where the line is drawn between
 idea and expression in art, reflecting the broader challenges with IP law
 of defining and protecting original works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protection Without Formalities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IP law grants authors exclusive rights to their creations without the need
 for formal registration processes.
 This principle, anchored in Article L.
 111-1 of the French IP Code, ensures that creators enjoy rights from the
 moment of creation, diverging from traditional copyright laws requirinig
 formal registration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Safeguards and systems for protection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
EU Directive 2001
\series default
: integrated into French law, this directive enhances protections for works
 shared on the Internet, addressing modern challenges in IP law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Deposit Systems
\series default
: while formal registration is not required for protection, deposit systems
 such as legal deposits, public registers for films, audiovisual works,
 and national registers for designs serve as additional safeguards.
 For example, publishers submitting copies of books to a national library
 as part of the legal system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Private Deposit Systems
\series default
: tools like the Soleau envelope or public notary deposits offer creators
 a means to document the creation date and details of their work, providing
 evidence that can be useful in disputes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Indifference to the Genre, Form of Expression, Merit and Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Article L.
 112-1 emphasizes that copyright protection extends to all intellectual
 works, regardless of their genre, form of expression, merit, or purpose.
 This inclusive approach ensures broad protection for creators.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
genre
\series default
 is the category of artistic composition to which the work in question belongs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
form of expression
\series default
 is the creative process or technique used within this genre.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The boundary between technical know-how and creative expression poses challenges
 to IP law, illustrated by varying court decisions on whether a perfume's
 scent can be copyrighted.
 The Paris Court of Appeal and the Cour de Cassation have diverged in their
 rulings, highlighting the complexities of defining what constitutes a protectab
le work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Merit and public morals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Merit
\series default
: IP protection is not contingent on a work's aesthetic value.
 Video games, for instance, have been recognized for legal protection as
 original intellectual creations regardless of artistic merit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Public morals
\series default
: protection extends to works without regard to their conformity to public
 morals.
 However, the law remains sensitive to the public interest and moral standards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Manual copies
\series default
: the Cour de Cassation has ruled that manual reproductions of artworks
 can qualify as derivative works eligible for copyright protection, emphasizing
 the personal touch involved in such reproductions.
 For instance, copies made in a museum are considered a lawful activity
 as long as the work is not sold as an original work of art and it is compulsory
 to use a canvas of a special size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose and the Unity of Art principle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distinction between pure art is often blurred, leading to debates over
 what qualifies for protection.
 The principle of the 
\series bold
Unity of Art
\series default
 advocates for a broad interpretation, extending copyright proection to
 a wide range of creations, from functional objects like bottle openers
 to traditional art forms like statues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Application of the Protection Criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Article L.
 112-2 of the French IP Code provides an indicative list of protected works,
 but protection is not limited to this list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Staging of performing arts events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
General rule
\series default
: the staging of performing arts events is typically not considered a work
 eligible for copyright protection because such events are often viewed
 as performances rather than creative works in themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Exception
\series default
: a director who significantly modifies or adds original elements to hiw
 own work can transform a performance into a protectable work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Collections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
General rule
\series default
: collections or series or works that are not inter-related are generally
 not considered individual works of copyright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
The Schlumpf affair
\series default
: this case highlighted the complexity of determining copright eligibility
 for collections.
 This case involved a controversy over the collection of vintage automobiles
 by Fritz Schlumpf, one of the most prominent car collections in the world.
 The legal disputes primarily focused on issues of ownership, classification
 of the collection as cultural heritage, and the rights associated with
 the collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Contrasting case
\series default
: the Henri Langlois cinema museum case offered an opposite solution, recognizin
g certain collections as protectable under copyright law.
 Unlike the Schlumpf Affair, which centered around ownership and heritage
 classification, issues around the cinema museum could touch upon copyright
 considerations, especially concerning the protection of film archives,
 promotional materials, and other items that involve creative expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Language and computer science
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Language
\series default
: the borrowing of extensive portions from scholarly works on specific languages
, like the example involving Cajun and Hermann languages, demonstrates the
 challenges in protecting language-based works when they lack original expressio
n.
 However, inventions like the creative narrative in 
\emph on
Clockwork Orange
\emph default
, can qualify for protection if they embody original creative expression.
 This is a novel by Anthony Burgess, adapted into a film by Stanley Kubrick.
 The work is known for its inventive language (Nadsat) and its exploration
 of themes like free will, violence, and societal control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Computer science
\series default
: generally, the field is seen as technical and not eligible for copyright.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Exceptional consideration of work's purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
General rule
\series default
: documents intended for widespread public circulation are usually not protected
 to ensure access to information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Annotations
\series default
: in contrast, original annotations or commentary accompanying such documents
 can be protected, highlighting the importance of creative expression over
 the informational content.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Speeches
\series default
: both general speeches and those in legal settings may receive protection,
 albeit with certain limitations to balance freedom of expression and informatio
n dissemination.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Visual arts: composition and expression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Handmade copies
\series default
: reproductions of artworks, if created by hand, can be considered derivative
 works eligible for proteciton, emphasizing the role of the artist's personal
 touch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Expression vs.
 Composition
\series default
: the law often distinguishes between the 
\emph on
expression
\emph default
 of ideas (protected) and the 
\emph on
composition
\emph default
 of ideas (not protected), underscoring the principle that copyright protects
 the form of expression rather than the idea itself.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For example, consider a recipe for a cake:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Composition: the list of ingredients for the cake and the basic steps represents
 the composition.
 This aspect is generally not copyrightable because it pertains to the idea
 or functional aspect of making a cake.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Expression: the way the recipe is written, including the narrative style,
 unique instructions, personal anecdotes, or creative presentation in a
 cookbook, constitutes the expression.
 This can be copyrighted because it reflects the author's original way of
 expressing the idea of making a cake.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
Application of the Criterion of Originality: Special Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Photographic Works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-1985 view: originality was often tied to the artistic merit of the photograp
h, leading to conflicts with the broader principles of copyright law, which
 seeks to protect the expression of ideas rather than their artistic value
 or merit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Post-1985 view (Lang Act): this legislation clarified that the sole criterion
 for the copyright protection of photographs ir originality, emphasizing
 the photographer's personal creative choices, such as angle, lighting,
 and composition, over the subject matter itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Controversy over artwork photos: new debates have arisen regarding the copyright
ability of photographs of artworks, especially when such photographs attempt
 to replicate the original works as faithfully as possible without adding
 any personal creative contribution.
 When they are original, they are considered derivative works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a photograph capturing a unique moment or perspective, such
 as a specific lighting effect or angle on a common subject, can demonstrate
 the photographer's personal stamp, making it eligible for copyright protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Titles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Article L.
 112-4 IPC: titles can be protected under copyright, unfair competition,
 and trademark law, depending on their originality, distinctiveness, and
 potentional confusion with existing titles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Originality and distinctiveness: the protection of titles hinges on their
 ability to reflect the author's personal creativity.
 Given the brevity of titles, this often involves assessing their unconventional
 aspects or how they contribute to the work's identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Translations: the originality of translations, including titles, is evaluated
 based on whether they offer a ltieral rendering of the original or incorporate
 creative choices that distinguish them as new, original works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a title like 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

The Unbearable Lightness of Being
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 reflects the author's personal creativity and is distinctive enough to
 be protected under copyright law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Derivative Works, Collections and Databases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Degree of originality: the focus is on the originality manifested either
 in the selection and arrangement of the contents (for collections and databases
) or in the adaptations and transformations made to existing works (for
 derivative works).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Legal evolution: the law has evolved to recognize that the originality criterion
 can be met by the original selection or arrangement of materials within
 a collection or database, as seen in changes to Article L.
 112-3.
 Port-1998, for copyright to apply, the collection or database must exhibit
 originality in the choice or presentation of its contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an anthology of poems selected and arranged in a manner that
 reflects the compiler's unique vision or perspective on the theme, thereby
 qualifying as an original work due to the originality in selection and
 presentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Authorship and Ownership of the Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Authorship
\series default
 refers to the creation and original expression found in the work, attributing
 the work to the individual or group who conceived it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Ownership
\series default
 pertains to the bundle of rights associated with the work, including the
 right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, or create derivative
 works.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While authorship is inalienable and permanently tied to the creator, ownership
 of rights can be transferred or licensed to others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ownership belongs to the author 
\emph on
Ab Initio
\emph default
, meaning that from the moment of creation, ownership of the rights to a
 work inherently belongs to the author.
 This principle affirms the personal connection between a creator and their
 creation, ensuring the creator's initial control over how the work is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Principles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Article L.
 111-1, only natural persons can be recognized as authors, emphasizing the
 requirement for a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

minimum of freedom of creation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that allows individuals to express their personality through their works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A contractual agreement cannot alter the status of an individual as the
 author of a work.
 This status is inherent and protected by law, regardless of any agreements
 concerning the transfer of ownership rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Presumptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Legal fact and simple presumption (Article L.
 113-1): the law provides for a simple presumption that the person under
 whose name the work is published is the author, barring evidence to the
 contrary.
 This presumption facilitates the enforcement of copyright and the attribution
 of authorship.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Judicial presumption for legal entities: since 1993, a judicial presumption
 allows legal entities to act as the owners of copyright for works published
 under their name, particularly in cases of exploitation.
 This presumption addresses the practical aspects of copyright enforcement,
 especially concerning third-party infringers, but does not negate the principal
 that only natural persons can be authors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Special Cases
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IP law encounters unique challenges when addressing works that involve collabora
tion or non-traditional forms of creation and attribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Work designed by one artist and produced by another person
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During the interwar period, Dunand, an artist, designed decorative items
 for large liners.
 While Dunand conceived and designed these items, they were physically produced
 by technicians who had no creative freedom in their execution.
 In this scenario, Dunand retains the copyright for his original designs,
 as the creative force behind the work.
 This emphasizes the distinction between the conception of a work and its
 material execution, with copyright protection extending to the creative
 idea and design rather than the manual labor of production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Derivative works: the role of the engraver
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An engraver who transposes a drawing or a painting into an engraving does
 more than merely reproduce the original work; they interpret and recreate
 it, thus producing a derivative work.
 This process involves creativity and personal input that can qualify the
 resulting engraving as a new, copyrighted work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Material execution: the Renoir/Guino affair
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This case highliths the significance of material execution in determining
 copyright.
 When a work is conceived by one person but executed by another, legal and
 doctrinal debates arise regarding who holds the copyright.
 In the Renoir/Guino affair, sculptures conceived by Renoir and executed
 by Guino raised questions about the attribution of copyright, illustrating
 how collaborative works challenge traditional notions of authorsgip and
 ownership.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Anonymous works or works published under a pseudonym
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Author's choice and responsibility: authors may choose to publish works
 anonymously or under a pseudonym, which can complicate copyright attribution.
 If the author's identity is not disclosed, the responsibility lies with
 the author or their representatives to maintain secrecy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Calculation of rights: for anonymous or pseudonymous works, copyright duration
 is typically set at 70 years from the date of publication, unless the author's
 identity is revealed earlier.
 This ensures that the works remain protected while accounting for the uncertain
ty regarding the author's identity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Author's Status: Paid Employee, Civil Servant or Working To Order
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The underlying principle in all these scenarios is that copyright rights
 inherently belong to the author from the moment of creation, with specific
 legal nuances based on the context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Employment contract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
General rule (Article L.
 111-1)
\series default
: the mere existence of an employment contract does not automatically transfer
 copyright from the author to the mployer, ensuring that authors retain
 their rights unless explicitly transferred through an agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Collective work exception
\series default
: the rights to works created as part of a collective effort may be presumed
 to belong to the employer, especially when the work's creation is within
 the scope of employment duties and intended as a collective project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a graphic designer employed by an advertising agency creates
 artwork for a campaign.
 While the agency may own the physical designs, copyright remains with the
 designer unless explicitly transferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Commissioning contract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cour de Cassation ruling: echoing the principle, any transfer of copyright
 principles in the context of a commissioned work must be explicitly agreed
 upon in a contract.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ownership VS materialization: while the physical medium of a work can be
 owned by the commissioning party, the IP rights remain with the author
 unless specifically transferred.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an author is commissioned to write a novel for a publishing
 house.
 The copyright belongs to the author, and specific rights to publish and
 distribute the book would need to be contractually transferred to the publisher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Public officials or civil servants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Pre-2006 position: traditionally, public officials were not entitled to
 copyright over works created as part of their official duties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
2006 legal reform: introduced nuances to this rule, allowing for exceptions
 (though no exception is defined) where public officials could retain copyright
 on their works, with particular emphasis on situations where their professional
 duties do not inherently involve creating copyrightable works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a researcher employed by a government agency develops a new
 analytical method.
 The copyright rights associated to this method are public.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Collective works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A collective work is characterized by contributions from multiple authors
 who work under the incitative and direction of a person or entity that
 publishes the work under its name.
 In such cases, copyright rights may belong to the publisher or commissioning
 entity, recognizing their role in organizing, financing, and managing the
 creation and publication of the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even in this context, the individual authors' moral rights remain protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a publisher commissions a series of essays from various authors
 and publishes them as a single volume under the publisher's name.
 The publisher may hold the copyright for the collection as a collective
 work, while individual authors retain rights to their respective essays.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Works Created by Several Authors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A work of joint authorship involves the creative contributions of several
 natural persons, classified not by the extent of each person's contribution
 but by the collective effort towards a common project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an interview may typically credit the journalist as the author.
 However, if the interviewee significantly shapes the content or presentation,
 as in the case provided, they can also be considered a joint author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regime, according to Article L.
 113-3, states that rights to the work are shared among co-authors, requiring
 unanimity for decisions regarding exploitation and defense of the work.
 Each co-author retains moral rights over their contribution and the work
 as a whole.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Duration of legal protection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The general rule, according to Article L.
 123-2, states that the copyright term for works of joint authorship lasts
 until 70 years after the death of the last surviving co-author, ensuring
 extended protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A special regime applies, considering specific roles (e.g., scriptwriter,
 director, composer) as co-authors, with the term determined by the death
 of the last co-author from a pre-established list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Works under one's name
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Works created under the initiative and name of a publisher or legal entity,
 where individual contributions merge into the collective work, making it
 difficult to attribute distinct rights to any one author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jurisprudence differentiates between contributions to a collective work
 and independent works, requiring explicit transfer of rights for elements
 not inherently part of the collective creation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remuneration of the author
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, authors contributing to a work of joint authorship are entitled
 to remuneration proportional to their contribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For certain types of works, like dictionaries and periodicals, flat-rate
 payments can be established, acknowledging the standardized nature of contribut
ions to these collective works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Authors' legal rights over their contributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contributors must be able to identify their contributions, which can be
 exploited separately, provided this does not affect the overall exploitation
 of the joint work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the collective work's purpose cannot be altered without consent, individua
l contributors retain moral rights over their contributions, ensuring respect
 for their personal connection to the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Composite or derivative works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Composite or derivative works represents a significant category within intellect
ual property law, involving the creation of new works that incorporate pre-exist
ing ones without the original author's collaboration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Composite work (article L.
 113-2)
\series default
: a new creation that includes a pre-existing work, either through transformatio
n (intellectual incorporation) or by including the material as is (material
 incorporation), without the participation of the original author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Rights and Ownership (article L.
 113-4)
\series default
: while the composite work is the property of the author who produced it,
 this ownership respects the rights of the original author.
 The original author retains the exclusive and absolute right to authorize
 or forbid the use of their work within the new creation, typically receiving
 compensation for its use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
La cage aux folles
\emph default
 case: an Italian producer obtained the international film rights for this
 film, with the exception that the play could not be directly adapted into
 an English-language film produced in USA.
 When the play was later adapted into a Broadway musical, which was then
 adapted into a film, the Italian producer argued that this constituted
 a direct adaptation of the original play, violating the agreement.
 The Cour de Cassation ruled in favor of the Italian producer, highlighting
 the nuanced interpretation of adaptation rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
La Tosca
\emph default
 case: the Italian publishers who held the rights to this opera, which was
 based on the play, sold the film adaptation rights without seeking permission
 from the original author's heirs for this new form of adaptation.
 The Court ruled that the permission granted by the original author was
 limited and did not extend to film adaptations, ilustrating that each new
 adaptation form might require explicit authorization from the copyright
 holder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While adaptations may take liberties with the original material, there is
 a legal and moral expectation that they respect the spirit and substance
 of the original work.
 However, case law has shown a liberal stance towards adaptations, as demonstrat
ed by the adaptations of 
\emph on
Fantômas
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
Le Petit Prince
\emph default
, where significant changes were deemed to respect the original spirit,
 though not without controversy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Status of the author of the composite work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The individual who adapts a pre-existing work into a new form is considered
 the sole author of the composite work, with specific provisions for audiovisual
 productions recognizing the collective nature of such creations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protection of the composite work follows common law provisions, lasting
 70 years after the death of the last surviving author.
 Notably, agreements can limit the period during which an adaptation is
 authorized, affecting the duration of the exploitation rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Final considerations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Creative freedom VS rights of the original author: while there is considerable
 creative freedom in making adaptations, it's crucial to negotiate and respect
 the rights and expectations of the original author, including compensatory
 agreements and adherence to the original work's spirit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Legal agreements: explicit agreements detailing the scope of adaptation
 rights and any limitations on the exploitation of the composite work are
 essential to prevent legal disputes and ensure that all parties' rights
 are protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Moral rights: the case law underscores the importance of balancing the adapter's
 creative expression with the need to respect the original work's integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Exclusive Right of the Author Over His or Her Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exclusive rights of authors over their works are an important issue
 of copyright law, granting creators control over how their works are used,
 distributed, and modified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two aspects:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Unfinished works
\series default
: authors have exclusive rights over their unfinished works, protecting
 them from unauthorized use, publication, or distribution.
 This ensures that authors can control the completion and release of their
 works according to their vision and timing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Distinction between tangible and intangible ownership
\series default
:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Article L.
 111-2 establishes that the ownership of a work is distinct from the ownership
 of the material object in which the work is materialized.
 For example, owning a painting physically does not grant the owner copyright
 over the artistic work itseld.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Article L.
 111-3 addresses situations where an author needs access to the original
 work, that is in the possession of another party for the purpose of exploiting
 the work.
 If the holder of the physical object refuses access and this refusal constitute
s manifest abuse, legal sanctions can be applied to ensure the author's
 rights are respected.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
For works that are published posthumously or long after their creation,
 there is an additional protection period.
 Works published for the first time after the end ot the copyright monopoly
 are granted an additional monopoly of 25 years.
 This extension aims to protect the interests of the authors or their heirs,
 encouraging the publication of previously unnplublished works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Moral Right
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moral rights represent the personal and perpetual connection between an
 author and their work, reflecting an aspect of the author's personality
 rather than their pecuniary interests.
 Unlike patrimonial rights, moral rights safeguard the personal and reputational
 interests of authors in their works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moral rights are not about ethical or moral behavior but concern the protection
 of the author's personal relationship with their work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These rights defend the non-financial interests of authors, ensuring respect
 for their creation and integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Characters Involved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Article L.
 121-1 states that moral rights are inherently linked to the author as an
 individual, underscoring the work as an extension of the author's personality.
 These rights are perpetual, even passing to the heirs, and are inalienable,
 meaning they cannot be transferred or renounced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There is an exception for works of joint authorship, in which certain moral
 rights can be attributed to the publisher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The principal characteristics of moral rights are that they are inalienable
 and perpetual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moral rights are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Paternal right
\series default
: authors have the right to be recognized as the creator of the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Disclosure right
\series default
: authors have the right to decide when or if their work is published.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Legal proceedings and enforcement
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Exercise of rights: authors are free to exercise their moral rights without
 limitation, including initiating legal actions to defend these rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Abuse of rights: while authors have broad discretion in exercising their
 moral rights, heirs may face accusations of abusing these rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Enforceability and devolution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Perpetual right: the perpetual nature of moral rights means they persist
 indefinitely, not subbject to waiver or loss through non-use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Devolution system: Articles L.
 121-1 and 2 outline how moral rights may be managed after the author's
 death, including provisions for the court to make decisions in the interest
 of preserving the authpr's legacy in cases where there are no direct heirs
 of the heirs intentions are unclear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Attributes of Moral Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Right to disclose the work (Article L.
 121-2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This right allows the author exclusively to decide when, how, and if their
 work should be made public.
 It encompasses various forms of making the work available to the public,
 including publishing, public exhibition and theatrical performances.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The decision to disclose a work directly affects its copyright status and,
 by extension, its property rights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author's intention to disclose must be explicit.
 Depositing manuscripts in archives or entrusting paintings to a gallery
 without explicit intent for public exhibition does not consitute discloure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The right of disclosure is absolute, but nuances exist, such as the possibility
 of new disclosures if the form of expression changes significantly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Right of disclosure and commissioning contract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
whistler jurisdprudence
\series default
 refers to the principle that ownership of a commissioned work transfers
 to the commissioner only upon the work's completion and delivery.
 If an author refuses to disclose a commissioned work, legal and monetary
 implications are considered, focusing on the duty to complete the commission
 and the potential for damages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Right to the respect of the name, paternity, and integrity of the work (Article
 L.
 121-1)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Authors have the right to be recognized as the creators of their work and
 to protect the work from any alterations that could harm their reputation
 or the work's integrity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These moral rights can limit how a work is used or modified, regardless
 of who holds the economic rights, with certain allowances for criticism
 and adaptation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thile moral rights protect the work's integrity, they do not prevent legitimate
 criticism or commentary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Right of withdrawal or reconsideration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This right allows the author to retract their work from the public domain
 or modify it after publication, under the condition that any damage to
 the licensee or assignee is compensated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an author decides to re-exploit the work, the original licensee or assignee
 may have a priority right to be the first to exploit the new version under
 the initially agreed conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Patrimonial Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patrimonial rights allow authors to derive financial benefit from their
 works through the exclusive control over reproduction, distribution, and
 other forms of exploitation.
 These rights are fundamental to copyright law, enabling creators to authorize
 or prohibit the use of their works in various ways.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Principle of Exclusive Right
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The author possesses the exclusive right to exploit their work in any form
 and to gain financial rewards from such exploitation.
 This encompasses both the right to authorize specific uses of the work
 and the right to prohibit other from exploiting it without permission.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While inherently individual, the management of these rights can be collectively
 organized, especially concerning rights that are difficult to enforce on
 an individual basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main powers originally granted by the code, and a third added
 one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Right of reproduction
\series default
: defined as the material fixation of the work allowing it to be communicated
 to the public indirectly.
 This includes digital reproduction on computer systems, temporary copies,
 and partial reproductions, subject to authorial consent unless exceptions
 apply (e.g., quotations or educational use).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Right of public performance
\series default
: involves the right to control the public presentation of the work, whether
 through physical performance, broadcasting, or digital streaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Right of resale
\series default
: entitles the author to a percentage of the sale price each time the work
 is resold, providing ongoing benefits from the work's circulation in the
 art market.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Right of Reproduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
EU definition
\series default
 encompasses the comprehensive right to authorize or prohibit any form of
 reproduction, highlighting the breadth of control authors have over their
 creations.
 The law also specifies certain situations where reproduction does not require
 the author's permission, such as for educational or research purposes,
 maintaining a balance between copyright protection and public interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Adaptation rights
\series default
: these rights are closely linked to moral rights, ensuring that adaptations
 respect the original work's integrity and that authors control how their
 work is transformed or adapted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Right of destination
\series default
: authors must authorize any change in the use of their work, such as converting
 a novel into a screenplay or changing the format from physical to digital,
 ensuring control over the work's exploitation across different mediums
 and contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Collective management (Article L.
 122-10)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The law mandates the automatic transfer of reprographic reproduction rights
 to a collective management organization, facilitating the efficient management
 and enforcement of these rights, particularly in contexts like photocopying,
 where individual enforcement is impractical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The Right of Public Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This right encompasses any form of dissemination that makes the work accessible
 to people beyond a private circle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key aspects of this right are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Broad definition (Article L.
 122-2)
\series default
: this right covers the communication of the work by any means, including
 live performances, broadcasting, and digital streaming.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Potential audience
\series default
: the definition of public performance includes situations where the audience
 is merely potential, expanding the scope of what constitutes a public communica
tion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
New public
\series default
: any act that targets a new audicence or public is considered a new act
 of public performance, necessitating authorization from the rights holder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Online availability
\series default
: making a work available online is deemed a public performance because
 it allows potential access by a broad audience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Exceptions to Exploitations Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the transposition of the EU Directive in 2006, the scope of exception
 to exploitation rights, including the right of public performance, has
 expanded, balancing copyright protection with fundamental freedom and fair
 use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conditions for exceptions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No interference with normal exploitation: exception must not disrupt the
 typical market exploitation of the work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No prejudice to the author's interests: they should not unjustly harm the
 author's legitimate interests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Published works: generally, the work must have been made publicly available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some specific exceptions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Private copies
\series default
: this exception applies to copies made for personal, non-commercial use.
 This does not extend to software programs and databases, and only a single
 copy is permitted.
 Also, the original work from which the copy is made must be legally acquired,
 adhering to the principle 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fraus omnia corrumpit
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
 (fraud corrupts everything).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Short quotations
\series default
: allowed when justifiable by critical, debate, educational, scientific,
 or intructional nature.
 The quotations must not infringe upon the moral rights of the author, and
 the length of the quotation must be considered in relation to the size
 of the original and derivative works and the purpose of its inclusion.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Works that can be quoted include literary texts, articles, reports, and
 portions of musical compositions, provided the quotations are used within
 a context that justifies their inclusion, such as academic works, criticism,
 or news reporting.
 The work being quoted must be adequately attributed to its original author,
 respecting the right of paternity.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Resale Rights
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Resale rights, historically unique to certain jurisdictions like France,
 have seen broader adoption internationally, including in the US, Germany,
 and other countries, due to efforts toward harmonization within the EU.
 However, the regulation of these rights has been critized for its negotiation
 and implementation inconsistencies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Resale rights
\series default
 entitle the original artist to a percentage of the sale price each time
 their work is resold on the art market.
 This applies particularly to graphic and visual arts, including original
 works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
Roding Jurisprudence
\series default
 clarifies that original works eligible for resale rights include those
 made directly by the artist or limited copies produced under the artist's
 supervision.
 This ensures artists continue to benefit from the increasing value of their
 works over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Agreements to Exploit the Work

Industrial Property
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What's A Patent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A patent is an immaterial title of private property granted by one or more
 states, providing a temporary monopoly on a novel and inventive invention.
 In exchange for this monopoly, the invention is published, making the details
 available to the public.
 The creation of a patent involves filing and examination processes, with
 a standard lifetime of 20 years.
 Patent law varies by country but operates within a broader intelelctual
 property (IP) toolbox that includes patents, utility models, design patents,
 trademarks, copyright, and protections for printed circuit borad topographies
 and databases, as well as animal and vegetal production processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Patent VS Trademark
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patents grant a temporary monopoly on technical inventions that meet criteria
 of novelty, inventiveness, and industrial applicability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trademarks protect distinctive names, logos, or symbols used to identify
 products or services, offering an unlimited renewable lifetime, country-depende
nt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Obtaining and exploiting a patent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process includes filing an application, which is then examined for novelty,
 inventive step, and industrial applicability.
 Once granted, the patent holder has the exclusive right to exploit the
 invention, which includes manufacturing, selling, or licensing the patented
 product or process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Other kinds of industrial property
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Utility model: a simplified patent.
 This protects inventions without requiring strong inventive steps, with
 shorther protection term than patents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Design model: protects the aesthetic aspects or appearance of a product,
 not its technical features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Printed circuit board topographies and databases: specific protections for
 the design of circuit boards and the organization of databases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Animal and vegetal production processes: special categories for agricultural
 innovations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Territorial validity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
France: governed by the Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle (CPI), covering
 various forms of IP.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Europe: The European Patent Convention (EPC) and the Unitary Patent Court
 (UPC) system provide frameworks for European patents and the upcoming unitary
 patent system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
USA: patents are governed by Title 35 of the US Code, with criteria focusing
 on utility, novelty, and non-obviousness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
WTO: the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement
s set minimum standards for IP protection, including patents, applicable
 to member states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Object of the Patent Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Patentability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Patentability criteria ensure that only inventions meeting specific standards
 can be protected by patentes.
 These criteria are designed to promote genuine innovation and contribute
 to technological advancement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To be patentable, the work must be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold

\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Possess 
\series bold
industrial application
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Novel
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Involve an 
\series bold
inventive step
\series default
 (non-obviousness).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Invention
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The subject matter of the patent must be a technical innovation.
 This can be a product, process, or any new and useful improvement thereof,
 capable of industrial application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a new type of battery with improved energy efficiency or a
 novel method for prifying water using less energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several kinds of inventions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
New solution to a known technical problem: innovations that provide new
 ways to address existing technical challenges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Selecting an optimal solution: choosing the most effective solution from
 a range of known options based on new criteria or considerations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Identifying a new technical effect: discovering previously unknown benefits
 or effects or a known method, device, or system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Formulating a new technical problem: recognizing and defining a previously
 unaddressed technical issue that requires a novel solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Industrial Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The invention must be useful; it has to have a practical application in
 any field of industry, including agriculture, fisheries, and services.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain fields might be excluded from patentability due to ethical reasons,
 lack of industrial applicability, or being mere abstract concepts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a machine that automates a specific manufacturing process is
 patentable due to its direct industrial application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Invention + Industrial Application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combination of having a technical solution to a problem or identifying
 a new technical problem with the requirement for industrial applicability
 ensures that patents are granted to innovations that offer practical technical
 improvements and are capable of being used in industrial settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Novelty
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The invention must be new or novel, meaning it cannot be part of the state
 of the art.
 State of the art includes anything that has been publicly disclosed, published,
 or otherwise made available to the public anywhere in the world before
 the filing date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, an electronic device featuring a never-before-seen combination
 of functionalities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inventive Step
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The invention must involve an inventive step, making it not obvious to a
 person skilled in the art.
 This criterion assesses whether the invention is a sufficient advance over
 what is already known.
 A person skilled in the art is a technician, in the technical field of
 the invention, that holds standard knowledge of the fields, and some knowledge
 in fields close to it, and with access to all documents that are available
 in the state of the art.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, a new method for conducting wireless communication that significant
ly reduces signal interference, which would not have been obvious to professiona
ls in the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Non-Patentability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Europe, the EPC and national laws, like CPI, outline specific categories
 of inventions that are not eligible for patent protection.
 This non-patentability stems from various reasons, including the nature
 of the invention, moral considerations, and the aim to protect public interests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Non-Inventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Aesthetic creations: items that are purely artistic or aesthetic in nature
 are not considered inventions under patent law because they do not possess
 a technical character or industrial application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mental acts: ideas, business methods, and social practices are not patentable
 as they do not translate into a technical solution to a technical problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Non-Patentable Fields (Non-Industrial)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Medical field (Articles L.
 611-16 / EPC: Article 53): methods for treatment by surgery or therapy
 and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body are excluded
 from patentability to ensure that medical and veterinary professionals
 can freely use their skills and knowledge for the benefit of all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Biological field and human body (Articles L.
 611-18 and 19 / EPC: Article 53-R29): the human body at various stages
 of formation and development, and the simple discovery of one of its elements,
 including the sequence or partial sequence of a gene, cannot be patented.
 However, an application of a gene sequence for industrial purposes can
 be patented.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Specific Exclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Computer programs (Article L.
 611-10 / EPC: Article 52): software or computer programs are not patentable
 to the extent that the patent application relates to the software alone,
 rather than a technical process or method involving the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Biological matter: certain biological processes and uses of biological material
 are excluded from patentability, such as cloning human beings, modifying
 the germ line genetic identity of humans, and using human embryos for indutrial
 purposes.
 Processes that cause suffering to animals without substantial medical benefit
 are also excluded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Software inventions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Variations by country: while the US initially had few restrictions on patenting
 software inventions, Europe maintaints a more stringent approach, focusing
 on the technical contribution of the software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Patentability criteria: in Europe, software can be part of a patentable
 invention if it serves a technical purpose or solves a technical problem,
 especially in the context of electronic data processing methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Authoring right: the creation of software code is protected under copyright
 law as an authoring right, emphasizing the distinction between copyright
 and patent protection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rights Conferred by the Patent
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grant of a patent confers specific rights to the patent holder, balancing
 the inventor's interests with public welfare.

 to invest time and resources into developing new inventions by offering
 the possibility of financial return upon disclosure of the invention to
 the public (usually after 18 months from filing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Limited right: the exclusivity is subject to specific criteria for patentability
, exceptions to patent rights, and a limited lifetime (typically 20 years),
 after which the invention enters the public domain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disputed right: the exclusivity can conflict with principles of commercial
 freedom and the ethos of open-source software, reflecting ongoing debates
 about the balance between private rights and public access.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Limits of protection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Product limits: a patented product can only be protected from unauthorized
 use, manufacture, or sale once; after it's sold, the patentee's control
 over that specific item ends (exhaustion of rights).
\end_layout
