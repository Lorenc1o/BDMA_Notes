\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many definition of what a model is, depending on the perspective
 used.
 For example, a model can be understood as a '
\emph on
standard or example for imitation or comparison
\emph default
' or as a '
\emph on
person employed to wear clothing ot pose with a product for purposes of
 display and advertising
\emph default
'.
 Nonetheless, in the context of decision modeling, which is the one in which
 we are interested, the definition of model is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box
status open

\begin_layout Definition
A 
\series bold
model
\series default
 is a 
\emph on
simplified representation of a system or phenomenon, with any hypotheses
 required to describe the system or explain the phenomenon, often mathematically
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models are useful to enhance our understanding of the world to improve our
 decision making, and they enable us to elaborate a scientific methodology
 to solve a problem in a duplicable way and with the aim of reducing bias
 in mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A model is said to be 
\series bold
deterministic
\series default
 if the outcomes are precisely determined through known relationships among
 states and events.
 This kind of models always produce the same output when given the same
 input.
 On the other hand, a model is 
\series bold
probabilistic
\series default
 (or stochastic) when all the data that it tries to explain is not known
 with certainty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, the Newtonian model for gravity is deterministic, while a predictio
n model for college acceptance is probabilistic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Deterministic models are used in domains such as Multi-Attribute Decision
 Making or Linear Programming, among others; while probabilistic models
 are used in queuing problems, simulations, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also classify the data that is used to define a model into 
\series bold
qualitative
\series default
 and 
\series bold
quantitative
\series default
.
 The former refers to data that is expressed in terms of words, while the
 latter is data easily expressed using numbers.
 An example of qualitative data is the hair color of people in class, and
 for quantitative data is the height of people in class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can be more precise in our wording, and call the models that we are talking
 about 
\series bold
formal models
\series default
, which refer to those models that provide a precise statement of the components
 of the model and their relationships, usually by means of mathematical
 equations.
 This make them easy to communicate precisely and the ability to give replicable
 results.
 However, being formal does not mean being true.
 A model can fail to represent the reality that it tries to describe.

Decision Theory and Decision Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box

\begin_layout Definition
A 
\series bold
decision
\series default
 is a choice that is made about something after thinking about several possibili
ties.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decisions appear in many domains, including Mathematics, Economics, Computer
 Sciences, Psychology,...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Definition

\series bold
Decision Analysis
\series default
 consists in trying to provide answers to questions raised by actors involved
 in a decision process using a model.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous definition, a 
\series bold
Decision Process
\series default
 refers to a strategy of intervention, such as aid, communication or justificati
on, among others.
 There are many ways to provide decision aid and no single way to compare
 methods.
 This, together with the fact that different models may lkead to different
 recommendations, makes it hard to assess when a Decision Analysis model
 is 'good' or, more appropriately, 'suitable'.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, we cannot compare decision making to solving a well-defined problem,
 as the former is highly dependent on opinions, interests and, more generally,
 different human factors involved.
 In every decision process, there are several possible interventions, among
 which we can find imagining compromises, communicating, coordinating, controlli
ng, motivating or conducting change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many different models used in Decision Analysis nowadays, with
 the 
\color blue
advantages
\color inherit
 of:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Providing a clear language that can be leveraged as a communication tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Capturing the essence of a situation, acting a structuration tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Answering '
\emph on
what-if
\emph default
' questions, serving as a exploration tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, their 
\color red
drawbacks
\color inherit
 are their high complexity and opaqueness.
 In addition, in many situations people could argue that such models are
 not necessary because they already know how to take decisions and they
 would over-complicate the process; or would ask for higher-level explanations
 or ideas that are not suitable for formalization; or would rather rely
 on their intuition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Main Steps of Developing a Decision Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Formulation
\series default
: translate the problem scenario into a mathematical model.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This involves the definition of the problem and the development of a decision
 model, i.e., the definition of the 
\series bold
variables
\series default
 or measurable quantities that vary, and the 
\series bold
parameters
\series default
 or measurable quantities inherent to the problem.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Solution
\series default
: solve the mathematical expressions from the formulation.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This process involves the development of the solutions by correctly manipulating
 the model to arrive at the best solution, and the testing of the solution,
 to check that it works as expected and meets the expectations.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Interpretation
\series default
: discover the implications of the results.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This is usually done by conducting 
\series bold
sensitivity analysis
\series default
, i.e., testing the different outcomes obtained under a variety of states;
 and 
\series bold
implementing results
\series default
, enacting the solutions and monitoring the performance.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The outlined process is very high level, and there are many possible problems
 that can arise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Defining the problem: we can find conflicting viewpoints that impact differently
 the stakeholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Model development: it is not always easy to find the formal model that describes
 the problem at hand, and it is usual to make adaptations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Acquering data: can be hard in some scenarios, as well as checking its validity
 and correctness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Developing a solution: we can find many limitations, such as only finding
 one answer, finding approximate answers, prohibitive computing times,...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Implementation: it is crucial that the solution is feasible to be implemented,
 both from a managerial point of view and from the user perspective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Decision's Algorithm & Transparency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Decisions made by algorithms can be opaque because of technical and social
 reasons, in addition to being made purposely opaque to protect intellectual
 property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box
status open

\begin_layout Definition
An 
\series bold
algorithm
\series default
 is a sequence of instructions, typically used to solve a class of problems
 or perform a computation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
It must be:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Finite: it must eventually solve the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Well-defined: the series of step must be precise and understandable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Effective: it must solve all cases of the problem for which it was defined.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually, we find contradictory objectives when developing an algorithm,
 because simpler algorithms are usually time intensive, while algorithms
 that are very efficient are very complex are hard to understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box
status open

\begin_layout Definition

\series bold
Algorithmic Transparency
\series default
 is the principle that the factors that influence the decisions made by
 algorithms should be transparent to the people who use, regulate and are
 affected by systems that employ those algorithms.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This concept is opennes about the purpose, structure and underlying actions
 of the algorithms used to search for, process and deliver information.
 Two important properties of transsparency are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Explanability
\series default
: systems and institutions that use algorithm decision making are encouraged
 to produce explanations regarding both the procedures followed by the algorithm
 and the specific decisions that are made.
 This is specially relevant in public policy contexts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Accountability
\series default
: institutions should be held responsible for decisions made by the algorithms
 they use, even if it is not feasible to explain in detail how the algorithms
 produce their results.

Preferences as binary relations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box
status open

\begin_layout Definition
Given a set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, a 
\series bold
binary relation
\series default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, is a subset of ordered pairs of elements in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R\subseteq X\times X.
\]

\end_inset

 We can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y\right)\in R$
\end_inset

 or, equivalently, 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relations can be expressed as directed graphs.
 For instance, a relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of a set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 can be represented as the graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}=\left(N_{X},E_{R}\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{X}$
\end_inset

 are the nodes, representing each element in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{R}$
\end_inset

 are the edges, representing each pair in 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 The edges are constructed in such a way that 
\begin_inset Formula $e=\left(x,y\right)\in E_{R}\iff xRy$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\left\{ a,b,c,d\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R=\left\{ \left(a,b\right),\left(a,c\right),\left(b,d\right)\right\} $
\end_inset

, then we can represent this by 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{R}$
\end_inset

 as:
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Another way to represent relations is using matrices.
 We can construct a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{R}$
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{R}=\left(m_{xy}\right)_{\left(x,y\right)\in X},
\]

\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m_{xy}=\begin{cases}
1 & if\ xRy\\
0 & if\ not\left(xRy\right)
\end{cases}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
The previous example can be represented with the following matrix:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
M_{R}=\begin{array}{cc}
 & \begin{array}{cccc}
a & b & c & d\end{array}\\
\begin{array}{c}
a\\
b\\
c\\
d
\end{array} & \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0
\end{array}\right).
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Definition
A 
\series bold
path
\series default
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $y\in X$
\end_inset

 exists if there are 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},...,x_{n}\in X$
\end_inset

 such that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x=x_{1}Rx_{2}R\dots Rx_{n-1}Rx_{n}=y.
\]

\end_inset

 A path is called a 
\series bold
cycle
\series default
 if the it goes from 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For every relation, we can extract two subrelations, as its symmetric part
 and its asymmetric part:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Color Box
status open

\begin_layout Definition
Given a binary relation 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, we can define its 
\series bold
symmetric part
\series default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
xIy\iff\left[xRy\land yRx\right],
\]

\end_inset

 and its 
\series bold
asymmetric part
\series default
, 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
xPy\iff\left[xRy\land not\left(yRx\right)\right].
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The symmetric part is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $I$
\end_inset

 because we can understand this as the all the indiferent pairs of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

.
 In others words, if we understand a relation as a preference over the elements
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy$
\end_inset

 would mean 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 is at least as convenient as 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 Therefore, if we have 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $yRx$
\end_inset

, we could think of them as equally convenient, so the decision between
 them is indiferent.
 On the other hand, the asymmetric part is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, from preference, following a similar reasoning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we have two different relations, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $R'$
\end_inset

, on the same set, 
\begin_inset Formula $X$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let's go one by one:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
By definition, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $xR\bullet Ry\iff\exists z:xRz\land zRy$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is transitive, then it must be 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $R\bullet R\subset R$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is not irreflexive, then there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in X$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $xRx$
\end_inset

, but this is a symmetric relationship, so 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 cannot be assymetric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Trivial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By reduction ad absurdum, seeking a contradiction, let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is not transitive.
 This means that there exist 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z\in X$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy\land yRz$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $not\left(xRz\right)$
\end_inset

.
 By hypothesis, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is asymmetric, so 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy\implies not\left(yRx\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If we combine these two facts, and use the hypothesis that 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is negative transitive, we find that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
not\left(yRx\right)\land not\left(xRz\right)\overset{neg\ trans}{\implies}not\left(yRz\right)\#
\]

\end_inset

 This is a contradiction, because we assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $yRz$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 must be transitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By reduction ad absurdum, seeking a contradiction, let's assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is not negative transitive.
 This means that there exist 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z\in X$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $not\left(xRy\right)\land not\left(yRz\right)$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $xRz$
\end_inset

.
 By hypothesis, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is complete, so 
\begin_inset Formula $not\left(yRz\right)\implies zRy$
\end_inset

.
 If we combine the two facts, 
\begin_inset Formula $xRz$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $zRy$
\end_inset

, then the transitivity of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 gives us 
\begin_inset Formula $xRy\#$
\end_inset

, which is a contradiction with our assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $not\left(xRy\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 must be negative transitive.

\begin_layout Itemize
Semi-transitive: Yes.
 Let's do this little by litte.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If we take 
\begin_inset Formula $x=a$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $aBt,\forall t$
\end_inset

, so it will hold.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $y=a$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\cancel{\exists}x$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $xBa$
\end_inset

, so it will hold.
 Same happens if 
\begin_inset Formula $z=a$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, if 
\begin_inset Formula $t=a$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $aBz,\forall z\in X$
\end_inset

, so it also holds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 (since we have seen all cases in which 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is involved), we obtain the relation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cc}
 & \begin{array}{ccccc}
b & c & d & e & f\end{array}\\
\begin{array}{c}
b\\
c\\
d\\
e\\
f
\end{array} & \left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 Using the same argument, 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 will work now.
 When we remove it, we get:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cc}
 & \begin{array}{cccc}
c & d & e & f\end{array}\\
\begin{array}{c}
c\\
d\\
e\\
f
\end{array} & \left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 And once again we can use 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 When we remove it, we get:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{cc}
 & \begin{array}{ccc}
d & e & f\end{array}\\
\begin{array}{c}
d\\
e\\
f
\end{array} & \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 1 & 0\\
1 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right)
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

 Now we can repeat the same with 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, and when we remove it we obtain a two-element relation, which is always
 semi-transitive.

We need to see that

\begin_inset Formula $x\left(B\cap B'\right)x\iff xBx\land xB'x,$

 which holds since

 are reflexive.

Symmetric: take 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y\in X$

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $x\left(B\cap B'\right)y$
\end_inset

 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $xBy\land xB'y$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B'$
\end_inset

 are symmetric, we obtain that 
\begin_inset Formula $yBx\land yB'x$

\begin_inset Formula $y\left(B\cap B'\right)x$

 This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $xBy,xB'y,yBz$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $yB'z$
\end_inset

 Now, since 
\begin_inset Formula $B$

\begin_inset Formula $B'$

 are transitive, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $xBz$

Reflexivity and symmetry are preserved, but what about transitivity? It

\[
B=\left\{ \left(a,a\right),\left(a,b\right),\left(a,c\right),\left(b,b\right),\left(b,a\right),\left(b,c\right),\left(c,c\right),\left(c,b\right),\left(c,a\right),\left(d,d\right)\right\} ,

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the intersection, the transitivity is preserved, following

\begin_inset Formula

B: & \left(a,b\right)\succ\left(c,d\right)\\
B': & \left(c,d\right)\succ\left(a,b\right).

 Then, the intersection is
\begin_inset Formula

B\cap B':a\equiv b,c\equiv d,

\begin_layout Standard
As for the union, the opposite happens.
 Completeness is preserved, because the relations involved are complete.
