\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We all know about the increasing amount of data collected and handled by
 companies and organizations, but it is also important to understand that
 data is not the same as information: it is needed a process of analysis
 and understanding to derive information from data.
 When we have a question that we want to answer with our data, we 
\series bold
query
\series default
 the data seeking for the pieces of data that might be relevant for our
 questions.
 On the other hand, we don't exactly know what we want to know, we 
\series bold
explore
\series default
 the data, looking for patterns that can give us insights and ideas we didn't
 thought about before.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, analyzing data is not always easy, and relying always in purely
 automated analyses can result in unexpected results, usually because of
 edge cases and situations that we did not think about at the beginning
 or which did not even exist by then, and because data can be incomplete,
 inconsistent or deceptive.
 Therefore, human judgement and intervention is often needed, to provide
 background information, flexible analysis, modifiable to unintended directions
 and creativity.

\series bold
 Visual analytics
\series default
 is then a field that provides different tools to have a human in the loop
 in analysis tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this course, we want to build a strong critical thinking with data, relying
 on visualizations that can help us to better understand data.
 We will delve into Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis
 and Visualization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is Visual Analytics?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
What is Data Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, there is the vision that data analysis consists in applying
 statistics to analyze data collected from the real world, but a more accurate
 vision would be to define data analysis as the task of thinking carefully
 about evidence, represented by data.
 Nowadays, this view is more spread, and data analysis is now covering a
 wide range of activities and skills:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Problem definition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Disassembling problems and data into analyzable pieces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Data evaluation & Conclusion making
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Decision recommendation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Visual Analytics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interacti
ve visual interfaces.
 It combines automated analysis techniques with interactive visualizations
 for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the basis
 of very large and complex data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The greatest challenge of visual analytics is to enable deep insights, allowing
 analysts to examine massive, multi-dimensional, multi-source and time-varying
 information, to make the right decisions in a time-critical manner.
 With this in mind, the method is to combine automated analysis with human
 intervention, and representing data visually to allow for interaction,
 insight generation, conclusions making and enabling for better decision
 making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field can be understood as a whole, but it can also be divided into:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Information Visualization
\series default
: visualizations that enable to transmit information to the general public
 in a clear way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Scientific Visualization
\series default
: visualizations that show scientific work and discoveries with precision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Infographics
\series default
: this represents a visual summary of a topic that aims at providing an
 easy-to-understand overview on a topic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As mentioned before, there are basically two approaches towards data analysis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Confirmatory Analysis
\series default
: starts with a hypothesis about the data and tries to confirm its validity.
 This kind of analysis focuses more on fully automated analysis methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Exploratory Analysis
\series default
: when there is no or little a-priori information about the data and we
 are not sure about which patterns and information can be present in the
 data, we can explore it to create hypotheses that will need to be confirmed
 later.
 It is in this area where visual analytics is most widely used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also understand visual analytics as a process, involving the following
 steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Information (data) gathering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Data preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Knowledge representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Interaction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Decision making
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the requirements for an interesting and efficient visualization
 analytics approach are the development and understaing of data transformations
 and analysis algorithms, analytical reasoning techniques, visual representation
s and interactions, and techniques for production, presentation and disseminatio
n.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
History of Visual Analytics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early 2000s, there was an outgrowth of the Scientific & Information
 Visualization community, which started with US National Visualization and
 Analytics Center (NVAC) at PNNL in 2004.
 This center developed the first research and development agenda “Illuminating
 the Path” sponsored initially by DHS (US Department of Homeland Security).
 At first, the goals of this center and of the field were analyzing terrorist
 threats, safeguarding boarders and ports, and preparing for and responding
 to emergencies.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The field has evolved since then to serve for larger research goals, specially
 since the first edition of the VAST symposium, a conference in visual analytics
, science and technology, as part of the IEEE Visualizations Conference,
 in 2006; in addition to fundation of the VisMaster in 2008 by the EU.
 This represented a coordination action to join European academic and industrial
 R&D, with a focus in broader aplicability in different scientific fields
 (physics, astronomy, weather,...) rather than homeland security.
 From this point on, many centers in Europe have been created to research
 in this field.

 than time and error.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Problem interdependence
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Analysis in the real world often does not consist of isolated problems or
 questions.
 Problems are usually correlated and how one is solved influences how one
 should approach another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Synthesis of analyses is needed.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Integration of analysis methods
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
It is simple to do many isolated analyses, but it is hard to integrate them
 well into one tool or interface for human analysis.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Scalability
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Information scalability
\series default
: capability to extract relevant information from massive and possibly dynamical
ly changing data streams.
 There are different methods to achieve this kind of scalability, among
 which we can find abstract data sets, filter & reduce data, or multi-resolution
 representation of data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Display scalability
\series default
: this referes to the capability of visualizations and tools to adapt to
 different types of displays (computer monitor, smartphone, smartwatch,...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Visual scalability
\series default
: refers to the capability of visualizations to effectively display massive
 datasets in terms of number of data items or data dimensions.
 It depends on the quality of the layout, the interaction techniques and
 the perceptual capabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Human scalability
\series default
: human skills don't scale, but the amount of people involved in the analysis
 task can, so we must seek to design techniques to scale from a single to
 multiple users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Software scalability
\series default
: software systems and algorithms must scale to larger and different da
