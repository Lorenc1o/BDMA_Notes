/*
    Basic JavaScript Programming
*/

/* Print Hello world! to the console */


/*
    1. Variables
*/

/* Define a variable called “greeting” and assigning it the value of “Hello world” */



/* What is your current age? */


/* What is the current datetime */


/* Print out these variables to the console */


/* A variable can be “undefined” at the beginning. */
/* “null” is a value that is assigned to a variable when the variable should represent no value. */




/*
    2. Operations
*/

/* Define two numbers and calculate something using plus (+), minus (-), multiply (*), divide (/) */





/* Check if two numbers are equal using === */


/* == and != allow you to compare two things that may not be of the same type. */



/*
    3. Functions
*/

/* Define a function called “multiply” to multiply two numbers */





/* Calling a multiple function and print the result */



/*
    4. Objects and Methods
*/

/* You can assign key-value pairs as an JavaScript object */






/* You can access the value in the object the dot (.) notation. */


/* Objects can have other objects and functions inside of them. */










/*
    5. Arrays
    Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array
    and https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp
*/

/* Define an arrary of fruits */





/* Replace an element */



/* Add a new element */




/* An array can store elements of any type. */



/* pop: extracts the last element of the array and returns it. */




/* push: append the element to the end of the array. */



/* shift: extracts the first element of the array and returns it. */



/* unshift: add the element to the beginning of the array. */



/* Other methods: filter(), forEach(), map(), reduce(), sort(), slice(), splice(), etc. */

/*
    6. Loops
*/

/* The classic way to cycle through array items is using a for loop over each index in the array. */




/* JavaScript provides a shorthand version of the above, to use when you don’t need the index (i). */




/* JavaScript also provides another approach to doing a for loop. */
