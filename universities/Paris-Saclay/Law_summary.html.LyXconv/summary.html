<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent">General rule imposed on human beings living in society and punished by public authority.
</p></p></div>
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent">
</p></div>
</div>
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecti-1000">rule of Law </span>is a fundamental principle that governs how a society operates. It means that all individuals,
institutions and entities, public or private, including the state itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly
promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human
rights principles.
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Characteristics </span>of the <span class="ecti-1000">rule of Law</span>:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Generality</span>: It targets everyone, or some specific kind of people, and it is applied equally.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Mandatory</span>: rules established by law must be followed, and there are consequences of not doing so. This happens
     regardless of the kind of rule:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent">Imperative rules: non-negotiable demands of the law. These define what must or must not be done.
         For example, criminal laws that prohibit theft.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent">Complementary rules: norms that can be modified or set aside by the parties involved, usually in the
         context of private law. For instance, parties entering into a contract can agree on terms that deviate
         from standard legal provisions as long as they do not violate imperative rules or public policy.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent">Both types of rules are mandatory as they establish a framework of legal obligations, but they differ in how
     strictly they bind the parties and their flexibility.
     </p></p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 147--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Validity</span>: refers to the legitimacy or authority of the legal rule. For a law to be considered valid:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent">It must be created by a legitimate authority or legislator.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent">It must follow the proper procedure for legislation, which often includes debate, public consultation,
         and adherence to constitutional principles.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent">It must be promulgated or published, making it known to the public before it can be enforced.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent">This characteristic ensures that laws are not arbitrary but are created through a recognized legal process that
     confers legitimacy and legal force.
     </p></p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Sanctionability</span>: once the rule is chosen, it will be applied with the risk of a sanction. Sanctions are the
     consequences or penalties for violating a law, and they serve as a deterrent against illegal behavior. This principle
     is crucial for the rule of law because it ensures that laws are not just theoretical but have practical
     effect.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 165--><p class="noindent">While <span class="ecbx-1000">legal rules </span>are formal, codified norms enforced by the state to regulate behavior and maintain order, <span class="ecbx-1000">moral</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">rules </span>are informal, subjective norms based on ethical principles and values that guide individual behavior. <span class="ecbx-1000">Natural</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">law</span>, meanwhile, is a philosophical theory suggesting the existence of universal, inherent moral principles that should
underpin human-made laws and ethical behavior. Each of these norms plays a distinct role in shaping human conduct,
societal norms, and legal systems.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a id="x1-30001.1"></a>Classification of Legal Rules</h4>
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 176--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Public Law</span>: governs the relationship between individuals and the state, as well as the relationships between
     different branches of the state. It is subcaterogized as:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Constitutional Law</span>: the foundation of the legal system of a country. It outlines the structure of
         the government, the distribution of powers among different branches (executive, legislative, judicial),
         and the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. It is the highest law, against which all other
         laws are evaluated.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 185--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Administrative  Law</span>:  covers  the  rules  and  procedures  that  govern  administrative  agencies  of
         the government. It deals with the actions and decisions of government departments and agencies,
         including rulemaking, enforcement of laws, issuing permits, and resolving disputes involving public
         administration.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 190--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">International  Public  Law</span>:  governs  the  conduct  of  states  and  international  organizations.  It
         encompasses treaties, conventions, and customs that regulate interactions between sovereign nations,
         including issues related to war, diplomacy, human rights, and territorial boundaries.</p></li></ul>
</p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Private Law</span>: deals with the relationships between private individuals or entities. It governs legal disputes that
     involve private parties and their rights and obligations. It is subcategorized as:
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 200--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">International Private Law</span>: deals with cases where foreign elements are involved, determining
         which jurisdiction’s law applies to a legal dispute and how judgements from one jurisdiction are
         recognized and enforced in another. For example, when two parties from different countries sign
         a contract, the matter of deciding which national law shall apply to the contract is a matter of
         international private law.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 206--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Civil Law</span>: the core of private law. It covers non-criminal disputes between individuals and entities,
         including laws on contracts, property, family relations, and inheritance. It establishes the rights and
         duties of private parties in their interactions.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 210--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Commercial Law</span>: it is a subset of civil law, that deals with issues related to commerce and trade
         between businesses and individuals, including contracts, transactions and business organization.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 213--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Labor  Law</span>:  this  area  governs  the  relationship  between  employers  and  employees,  including
         employment contracts, labor rights, working conditions and collective bargaining.</p></li></ul>
</p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 217--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Mixed</span>:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 219--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Procedural Law</span>: encompasses the rules that govern how courts and other legal institutions handle
         civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings. It includes the procedures for filing cases, conducting
         trials, and appealing decisions.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 223--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Criminal Law</span>: governs crimes and punishments. It defines what constitutes criminal behavior and
         specifies the sanctions (punishments) for such behavior. While it primarily deals with offenses against
         the state or society at large, it has elements of both public law (the state prosecutes offenders) and
         private law (in aspects like victim compensation).</p></li></ul>

<!--l. 233--><p class="noindent">
<ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">
<!--l. 234--><p class="noindent">Before the French Revolution, local laws in what is now France were divided between the <span class="ecbx-1000">Germanic</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">customary laws </span>in the north and the <span class="ecbx-1000">Roman laws </span>in the south. There laws were based on local customs
     and traditions, with Roman law influencing the legal systems due to the Roman Empire’s historical
     presence.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">
<!--l. 239--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Ordinances and Edicts of the King </span>began to replace local customary laws. Ordinances were more
     general laws, while edicts could address specific issues or grant rights and privileges. This centralization
     of legal authority under the monarchy was a step towards a unified legal system.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4006x3">
<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent">In the <span class="ecti-1000">ancien r</span><span class="ecti-1000">égime </span>of France, there were <span class="ecbx-1000">Parlements</span>, which were sovereign courts that registered the
     king’s edicts and could protest against them, although they could not ultimately prevent their enforcement.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4008x4">
<!--l. 248--><p class="noindent">In addition, there was the <span class="ecbx-1000">Canon Law</span>, the law governing the Church and its members, which was
     a significant source of law in Europe before the French revolution, especially in matters of marriage,
     legitimacy and inheritance.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4010x5">
<!--l. 252--><p class="noindent">Now, there are other sources of the contemporary law, divided into international and national sources:
         <ol class="enumerate2">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4012x1">
<!--l. 255--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">International Sources</span>: <span class="ecbx-1000">treaties </span>are international agreements that countries are bound to follow.
         The article 55 of the French Constitution acknowledges the superiority of treaties over national
         laws, provided they are ratified according to the constitution. In addition, there is the <span class="ecbx-1000">European</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">Union Law</span>, which is based on the Treaty of Rome (1957), that established the European Economic
         Community, now part of the European Union. EU law includes regulations and directives issued
         by EU institutions like the European Commision and the European Council, which have direct or
         indirect effect on member states’ laws and take precedence over national legislation.
         </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4014x2">
<!--l. 265--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">National Sources</span>: the <span class="ecbx-1000">Law </span>referes to statutes passed by the Parliament, while <span class="ecbx-1000">regulations </span>are
         issued by the executive branch (the government) and deal with matters not expressly reserved for
         law. In addition, there are <span class="ecbx-1000">decrees </span>and <span class="ecbx-1000">orders</span>, which are forms of regulation dealing with specific
         issues or individual matters, not considered as the law in the broader sense. For example, a decree
         might appoint public officials to certain administrative positions, or an order might impose temporary
         restrictions on water use in response to a severe drought in a department.</p></li></ol>
</p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4016x6">
<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent">Finally, we find the <span class="ecbx-1000">Constitution</span>, which is the supreme legal document, defining the fundamental principles and
     the organization of the state. It outlines the domain of laws passed by Parliament (matters of personal status,
     fundamental principles) and the Executive branch’s authority to issue regulations on matters not covered by law,
     except as specified in articles 38 and 16 of the French Constitution. Article 38 allows the government to legislate
     by ordinance in areas delegated by Parliament, while Article 16 grants the President exceptional powers under
     certain crisis conditions.</p></li></ol>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a id="x1-50001.3"></a>Drafting of a Law</h4>

<ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">
<!--l. 288--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Initiative</span>: the process of creating a new law begins with the initiative, which can be taken by the Prime
     Minister or member of the Parliament. This involves the drafting and proposal of a new law.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">
<!--l. 292--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Examination and voting</span>: the proposed law is examined, debated, and voted on by each assembly of
     Parliament (the National Assembly and the Senate).
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">
<!--l. 295--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Promulgation</span>: after a law is passed by Parliament, it is promulgated by the President of the Republic
     through a decree. Promulgation is the formal declaration that the law is enforceable.

<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x4">
<!--l. 298--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Publication</span>: the law is then published in the official gazette, and it becomes enforceable the day after

future and does not have a retroactive effect. This means that actions taken and situations that arose before the new
law’s enactment are governed by the law as it was at that time. The rationale behind this principle is to protect legal
certainty and individual’s trust in the law, ensuring that people can plan their actions according to the law without fear
of future changes affecting them retroactively.
<!--l. 373--><p class="noindent">However, the new law may apply to ongoing legal situations without retroactive effect. For instance, a

various purposes, like determining legal rights or liabilities, qualifying for exceptions or exemptions, or triggering or

of a marriage or the parentage of a child, which are relevant to legal issues like custody, support, and
inheritance.
<!--l. 712--><p class="noindent">The use of evidence in statutory facts is characterized by being free for civil status or filiation: this means that for
matters concerning an individual’s civil status (e.g., birth, marriage, death) or filiation (determining parent-child

specific legal restrictions may apply.
<!--l. 719--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Proof by legal documents </span>(article 1341 of the Civil Code): legal documents are the primary source of evidence for
asserting claims or defenses in court. These documents need to meet certain legal requirements to be considered

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.8   </span> <a id="x1-250001.8"></a>The Legal System</h4>
<!--l. 757--><p class="noindent">In France, there is what is called a <span class="ecbx-1000">Dual Jurisdiction</span>, which refers to the coexistence of two main types of
jurisdiction: administrative and judicial:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 761--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Administrative Jurisdiction</span>: Deals with disputes involving public administration, government agencies,
     and the actions of the government. It is separate from the ordinary courts and has its own hierarchy, with
     the Council of State (Conseil d’État) at the top.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 765--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Judicial Jurisdiction</span>: Handles civil and criminal cases involving individuals and private law disputes.
     This jurisdiction is what most people typically encounter when they go to court.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 768--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Court of Jurisdictional Conflict</span>: A special court that resolves disputes over whether a case should be
     heard by the administrative or judicial courts, ensuring that there is a clear demarcation between the two
     jurisdictions.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 773--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecbx-1000">principle of Double Degree of Jurisdiction </span>guarantees that most decisions from a first instance court can be
appealed to a higher court. It’s a fundamental right ensuring that parties have the opportunity for a second hearing.
However, there are exceptions for minor cases, where appeals may be limited to prevent an overload of the judicial
system.
<!--l. 780--><p class="noindent">We also find a classification of courts, regarding their hierarchy and specialization. For instance, courts dealing with
criminal matters are classified according to <span class="ecbx-1000">criminal jurisdictions</span>:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 784--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Tribunal de police</span>: deals with minor offenses (contraventions).

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a id="x1-310002.1"></a>Classification</h4>
<!--l. 939--><p class="noindent">Understanding the classification of contracts helps in grasping the legal implications and obligations that contracts
impose on the parties involved.
<!--l. 943--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.1   </span> <a id="x1-320002.1.1"></a>Classification Depending on the Type of Contract</h5>
<!--l. 945--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Named contracts </span>have specific designations and are recognized by law, such as sales, leasing, service contracts, work,
deposit, and company agreements. The advantage of named contracts is that they are already established by law, which
can be either supplementary (optional) or mandatory (compulsory).
<!--l. 951--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Unnamed contracts</span>, on the other hand, are complex and unique (<span class="ecti-1000">sui generis</span>). These contracts do not fit into the
predefined categories and may require special consideration and interpretation.
<!--l. 955--><p class="noindent">It’s important to note that this classification does not bind judges: there is <span class="ecbx-1000">judicial discretion</span>. In cases of mistakes or
dissimulation (concealment of truth), a judge has the discretion to interpret the contract beyond its classification. For
example, a contract may be classified as a service contract, while the reality behind the contract is a work relation. In
this case, the judge can interpret the contract as a work contract, even if it classified by the parties as a service
contract.
<!--l. 964--><p class="noindent">Contracts can also be classified as <span class="ecbx-1000">general agreements </span>or <span class="ecbx-1000">accessory agreements</span>, highlighting the primary versus
supplementary nature of the contractual obligations.
<!--l. 968--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.2   </span> <a id="x1-330002.1.2"></a>Classification Depending on the Object</h5>
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 970--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Bi-/Multi-Lateral (Synallagmatic) Agreements</span>: according to the Article 1106 of the Civil Code,
     synallagmatic agreements create recriprocal obligations for all parties involved. This means each party has
     duties towards the others, establishing a mutual dependency.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 974--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Unilateral  Agreements</span>:  conversely,  Article  1106  of  the  Civil  Code  also  mentions  that  unilateral
     agreements  impose  obligations  on  one  party  alone.  This  type  of  contract  involves  a  single  party’s
     commitment without requiring a reciprocal promise from another party. For example, I can post an offer
     of a reward in exchange for a lost wallet, setting up an unilateral agreement that stipulates that the reward
     will be issued once my wallet is found.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 982--><p class="noindent">This distinction is particularly relevant for mechanisms such as the <span class="ecti-1000">“exception d’inex</span><span class="ecti-1000">écution” </span>(defense
of non-performance), which includes suspension, resolution, and risk theory. These mechanisms allow
parties to respond to breaches of contract in a manner that reflects the mutual or unilateral nature of their
agreement.
<!--l. 988--><p class="noindent">The proof of contracts and their terms is subject to the dual original exigency, as stated in Article 1375. This means
that establishing the existence and specifics of a contract often requires adherence to strict legal standards, emphasizing
the importance of clear, mutual agreements and understanding.
<!--l. 994--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.3   </span> <a id="x1-340002.1.3"></a>Free-of-Charge Contracts or Contracts Drawn Up in Return for Payment</h5>
<!--l. 996--><p class="noindent">Contracts can be also classified based on the presence or absence of a financial consideration:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 999--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Free-of-Charge Contracts</span>: these are agreements where one party benefits without a requirement to
     provide a financial return to the other party. For example, in a donation, one party, the donor, transfers
     ownership of property or a sum of money to another party, the donee, without expecting anything in
     return.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1004--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Contracts Drawn Up in Return for Payment</span>: these involve transactions where services of goods are
     exchanged for payment. They can be either reciprocal or unilateral in nature, depending on whether both
     or one party is obligated to provide something of value.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1009--><p class="noindent">Within the realm of return-for-payment contracts, further subdivisions include commutative and aleatory contracts,
both of which are forms of synallagmatic agreements:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1013--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Commutative  contracts</span>:  these  contracts  involve  exchanges  where  the  reciprocal  advantages  are
     immediately known and can be evaluated. Each party knows what to expect and what is expected in
     return. For example, a sales contract, in which one party sells a product to the other party for a certain
     amount of money.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1018--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Aleatory contracts</span>: these are characterized by uncertainty. The advantages or obligations depend on
     an uncertain event (<span class="ecti-1000">al</span><span class="ecti-1000">éa</span>). The risk can be inherent to the contract’s nature or introduced by the parties’
     agreement. The principle here is that hazard nullifies tort (<span class="ecti-1000">“l’al</span><span class="ecti-1000">éa chasse la l</span><span class="ecti-1000">ésion”</span>), meaning a contract
     cannot be nullified due to the absence of cause or because of an unfair disadvantage (<span class="ecti-1000">l</span><span class="ecti-1000">ésion</span>), except
     in specific cases related to the aleatory element, like in life-contingent annuities (<span class="ecti-1000">rente viag</span><span class="ecti-1000">ère</span>). These
     contracts reflects an economic application of game theory, where the principle of large numbers does not
     apply uniformly, affected by the parties’ quality. An example of an aleatory contract is a life insurance
     policy, where the obligations of the parties involved depend on an uncertain event.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1033--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.4   </span> <a id="x1-350002.1.4"></a>Instantaneous Contracts and Contracts of Continuing Performance</h5>
<!--l. 1035--><p class="noindent">The execution timeline of contracts introduces another layer of classification:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1037--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Instantaneous contracts</span>: these are executed in a single action or step. Once the agreed exchange is
     made, the contract is considered fulfilled.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1040--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Contracts of continuing performance</span>: these require a certain period to be fully executed, establishing
     ongoing obligations over time.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1044--><p class="noindent">The interest of distinguishing between these types lies in the implications for declaring invalidity. For contracts of
continuing performance, rescinding or terminating the agreement can significantly impact the contractual relationship,
affecting how and when parties can exit the contract.
<!--l. 1050--><p class="noindent">The distinction between instantaneous and continuing performance contracts is <span class="ecbx-1000">relative</span>. A series of
instantaneous contracts can collectively resemble a continuing performance contract, especially in scenarios like a
processing contract or in the event of bankruptcy, where the ongoing nature of obligations comes to the
forefront.
<!--l. 1056--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.5   </span> <a id="x1-360002.1.5"></a>Contracts That Are Limited in Time or With A Termination Date</h5>
<!--l. 1058--><p class="noindent">Contracts of continuing performance often include provisions for <span class="ecbx-1000">tacit renewal</span>. This means that even without explicit
agreement, the contract can automatically renew under certain conditions. Such provisions allow for a
seamless continuation of the agreement, provided both parties continue to fulfill their obligations without
objection.
<!--l. 1064--><p class="noindent">A contract might be set without a specific deadline, being its end dependent of a particular event. According to a ruling
by the Cour de Cassation on October 28, 1992, the event triggering the contract’s end must be independent of the
parties’ will. This ensures the contract’s continuity is not arbitrarily controlled by either party, providing a fair and
predictable framework for its duration.
<!--l. 1071--><p class="noindent">For contracts without a fixed duration, unilateral termination is generally permissible at any time. However, this
termination must not be abusive (<span class="ecti-1000">“in case of excess”</span>) and should be executed with a reasonable period of advance
notice. The flexibility allows parties to exit agreements when they no longer serve their mutual interests, provided they
do so considerately and fairly.
<!--l. 1078--><p class="noindent">Article 1738 of the Civil Code provides a legal framework for tacit renewal, especially in the context of written leases.
If, at the expiry of the lease, the lessee remains in possession of the property with the lessor’s acquiescence, a new lease
is formed under the conditions of an unwritten lease, unless specifically excluded by the initial agreement or by the
contract’s nature.
<!--l. 1085--><p class="noindent">The general rule for renewed contracts is that they continue under the same conditions as the original, except for
certain clauses that may be considered divisible or specific to the initial term. Each renewal is treated as a new
contract, allowing for adjustments and updates to reflect the parties’ current circumstances and intentions. Notably,
unless explicitly agreed otherwise, a renewed contract under Article 1738 does not have a predetermined
termination date, reinforcing the importance of specifying any desired changes or limitations during the renewal
process.
<!--l. 1095--><p class="noindent">All these rules are meant to protect the interests of the weaker party in contractual relationships, such as in rental
agreements or employment contracts. By ensuring that renewals and terminations adhere to principles of fairness and
reasonable notice, the law aims to maintain balanced and equitable agreements.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.6   </span> <a id="x1-370002.1.6"></a>Classification Depending on the Status of the Different Parties</h5>
<!--l. 1103--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecti-1000">intuitu personae </span>(depending on the person) nature of certain contracts highlights the importance of personal
considerations in the formation of agreements. In such contracts, the specific characteristics or qualifications of the
parties involved are crucial, and a mistake regarding the identity or essential qualities of a party (<span class="ecti-1000">erreur sur la</span>
<span class="ecti-1000">personne</span>) can be a reason for nullifying the agreement. However, the importance of personal considerations has
diminished over time due to the growth and frequency of commercial exchanges, making it a less dominant factor in
many contractual relationship.
<!--l. 1113--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-380002.1.6"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">The Status of </span><span class="ecbi-1000">Consumer </span><span class="ecbx-1000">and </span><span class="ecbi-1000">Professional</span></span>
The distinction between a consumer and a professional is objectively defined within consumer law, as demonstrated by
the Cour de Cassation’s decision on May 15, 1984, concerning a patient’s relationship with a doctor. This distinction is
pivotal in determining the applicability of specific protections and obligations.
<!--l. 1121--><p class="noindent">Jurisprudence has further clarified this distinction, as seen in the case of May 3, 1998, where a priest purchasing a
photocopier for parish use was not considered a professional act due to its linkage to the parish’s activities. Conversely,
acts directly related to professional activity are deemed <span class="ecti-1000">professional</span>. This was adjusted from earlier jurisprudence,
which considered professional acting outside their area of expertise as consumers, as in the case of May 25, 1992,
regarding a reseller buying an alarm.
<!--l. 1130--><p class="noindent">Special rules apply to loans for consumers, where the object of the loan is a critical consideration. Since 1993, consumer
rights have been codified, encompassing rules on advertising, information, cooling-off periods, and retraction, alongside
mechanisms for control and enforcement against unfair terms.
<!--l. 1136--><p class="noindent">The codification of consumer rights aims to balance interests and promote <span class="ecti-1000">legal solidarism</span>, though it also introduces
some challenges. It disrupts traditional contract law principles, like consent, offer and acceptance, and can be seen as
unstable, bureaucratic, formalistic, and rigid. Critics argue that the emphasis on consumer protection
can hinder economic development by introducing additional costs and complexities. Special attention is
given to adults incapable of managing their affairs independently, whose protection is considered very
important.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1.7   </span> <a id="x1-390002.1.7"></a>Classification Depending on the Mode of Formation</h5>
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1147--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Consensual contracts</span>: these are based on the simple agreement of the parties involved. The essence of
     consensual contracts is that they are formed by the mutual consent of the parties regarding the contract’s
     terms, without the need for any formalities or the transfer of a thing. This principle is foundational
     in French law, as highlighted in Article 1172, which underscores the importance of consent in contract
     formation.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1154--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Real contracts</span>: real contracts require the transfer of a thing (an object or right) for the contract to be
     considered formed. Examples include loans (Article 1875), deposits (Article 1919), and pledges (Articles
     2071). These contracts are not complete until the specified object has been transferred from one party to
     the other.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1159--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Solemn contracts</span>: solemn contracts require specific formalities to be fulfilled for the contract to be
     valid.  These  formalities  could  include  written  documentation,  registration,  or  other  legal  procedures.
     The solemnity aspect underscores the contract’s importance, ensuring clarity and legal compliance. For
     example, a real estate contract that requires a notarized deed to be legally valid.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1165--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Negociated contracts</span>: these contracts are the results of back-and-forth negotiations between the parties,
     allowing for terms and conditions to be discussed and agreed upon before the contract is finalized. This
     type reflects a social reality where parties have equal bargaining power to shape the contract’s content.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1170--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Membership (adhesion) contracts</span>: membership contracts are standard form contracts where one party
     (typically a business or service provider) sets the contract terms, and the other party (usually a consumer)
     has little to no ability to negotiate. The consumer can aither accept the contract as is or reject it entirely.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1176--><p class="noindent">Despite the foundational role of Common Law principles in contracts, the issue of “unfair terms” has gained
prominence, addressing concerns over potential imbalances in membership contracts. This has led to specific regimes in
some foreign legal systems to protect parties, particularly consumers, from unfair or abusive terms that one party might
impose due to a superior bargaining position.

<!--l. 1189--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-420002.2.1"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Roman contracts and non-contractual obligations</span></span>
The Roman legal system introduced the notion of contracts with four primary consensual contracts: sale, mandate,
rental, and company.
<!--l. 1194--><p class="noindent">It also recognized non-contractual obligations such as guardianship and tort sources, expanding the scope of legal
obligations beyond formal agreements.
<!--l. 1198--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-430002.2.1"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Evolution from individualism to opposing interests</span></span>
In 1804, the notion of contract was heavily individualistic, anchored in the theory of free will (<span class="ecti-1000">autonomie de la volont</span><span class="ecti-1000">é</span>).
Over time, legal theory has shifted towards considering “opposing interests”, acknowledging the dynamic and often
conflicting nature of contractual relationships.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2.2   </span> <a id="x1-440002.2.2"></a>Unilateral Deed</h5>
<!--l. 1208--><p class="noindent">A unilateral deed, or unilateral declaration, involves a situation where a single party’s declaration or promise creates an
obligation upon them, without requiring acceptance or an act of performance by another party for it to take effect.
The obligation is self-imposed by the declarant’s will alone, and it must be communicated to the person
it affects, but it does not form an agreement between two parties. For example, a promise to make a
donation to charity can be considered a unilateral deed. If an individual publicly announces their intention
to donate a certain amount to a charity, they have created an obligation for themselves through their
declaration.
<!--l. 1219--><p class="noindent">A unilateral deed is distinguised from a unilateral contract by requiring only one party’s will to create an obligation,
while in a unilateral contract, the obligation is conditional upon the performance of a specified act by
another party, essentially forming an agreement once the act is performed. However, for such a deed to be
valid, the impacted individual must be informed, and there exists debate over the validity of self-imposed
obligations. An example is a public promise to reimburse, which can be revoked until the promised act is
accomplished.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2.3   </span> <a id="x1-450002.2.3"></a>Non-Mandatory Conventions</h5>
<!--l. 1230--><p class="noindent">Non-mandatory conventions, such as debt forgiveness, do not create obligations and are theoretically distinct from
contracts, despite being effective in practice.
<!--l. 1234--><p class="noindent">Another example are acts of kindness and accommodation, which are actions taken out of goodwill or to accommodate
someone else, such as providing a ride or assisting a third party withoyt expecting anything in return.
Initially, these acts may not create legal obligations. However, if they lead to harm or loss, they could
result in indemnity claims. Over time, such acts might be interpreted through a quasi-contractual lens,
especially if they resemble actions typically covered by contracts, like providing services under a free services
contract.
<!--l. 1243--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Gentleman’s agreements </span>are informal agreements based on the honor of the parties involved, rather than legal
obligations. They are characterized by:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1247--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Basis in honor</span>: the primary foundation of a gentlemna’s agreement is the personal integrity and honor
     of the parties. Such agreements are common between states or friends, where formal contracts are either
     impractical or deemed innecessary.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1251--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Legal enforceability</span>: while the legal doctrine often views these agreements as non-binding due to the
     lack of legal obligations, courts sometimes consider the common intentions of the parties involved. If it
     appears that the parties intended to create a binding commitment, a court may enforce the agreement
     based on those intentions, despite the informal nature of the agreement.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1258--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Letters of intent </span>are documents used during the preliminary stages of negotitations to outline the key elements
of a proposed agreement and the parties’ intent to continue discussions. They serve several important
functions:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1263--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Clarification of intentions</span>: they help both parties clarify their intentions and the main points of the

     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1266--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Non-binding nature</span>: typically, they are non-binding regarding the final agreement, meaning they do
     not legally obligate the parties to finalzie the deal. However, certain parts of a letter of intention, such as
     confidentiality clauses or exclusivity agreements, may be binding.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1271--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Ambiguity and enforcement</span>: the notion of letter of intention is ambiguous because, while they signify
     a willingness to engage in negotiations, the extent to which they are enforceable varies. If a letter of
     intention is detailed and includes terms that suggest a commitment, courts may interpret it as binding,
     depending on the parties’ apparent intent and the document’s specific language.</p></li></ul>

<!--l. 1295--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Synallagmatic promise</span>: involves mutual commitments from both parties to enter into a contract upon

<!--l. 1332--><p class="noindent">The formation of a contract is a fundamental concept in contract law that outlines the conditions under which
agreements become legally binding between parties.
<!--l. 1336--><p class="noindent">The Article 1103 of the Civil Code establishes that contracts, once legally constituted, are binding upon the parties
involved, acting as their law. This principle underscores the autonomy and the binding nature of contracts, highlighting
the importance of agreements being formed in compliance with legal standards. It specifies four essential requirements
for a contract’s validity:
     <ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-49002x1">
<!--l. 1343--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Consent of the parties</span>: agreement must be made without coercion, mistake, or misrepresentation. Both
     parties must clearly and voluntarily agree to the contract terms.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-49004x2">
<!--l. 1346--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Capacity to contract</span>: parties must have the legal ability to enter into a contract. This typically means
     they are of a certain age (usually 18 or older) and of sound mind.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-49006x3">
<!--l. 1349--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Definite object</span>: the contract must have a clear subject matter or obejctive. This means the goods,
     services, or rights being exchanged are specified.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-49008x4">
<!--l. 1352--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Lawful cause</span>: the purpose and terms of the contract must be legal and not against public policy.</p></li></ol>
<!--l. 1355--><p class="noindent">Notably, Article 1108 does not mandate a specific form for the contract, allowing for flexibility in how agreements are
made, whether orally, in writing, or through conduct.

<!--l. 1361--><p class="noindent">The formation process emphasizes the voluntary nature of agreements, detailing how parties should conduct
negotiations:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1364--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Discussions</span>: the initial stage involves discussions, which are not the same as making a firm offer. It’s an
     invitation to negotiate, marking the start of potential contract formation.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1367--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Invitation  to  start  discussions</span>:  this  is  distinct  from  a  firm  offer  and  serves  as  the  initiation  of

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1370--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Freedom to end negotiations</span>: parties are free to withdraw from talks at any time before an agreement
     is reached.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1372--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Obligations of good faith</span>: throughout the discussions, parties are expected to engage honestly and
     fairly, avoiding misleading or deceitful practices.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1375--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Informing and cooling off period</span>: parties should inform each other about the terms and conditions
     of the proposed agreement. A cooling-off period may be allowed, giving parties time to reconsider their
     commitment.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1379--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Effort to reach an agreement</span>: negotiations should aim to conclude with a mutual agreement, avoiding
     unnecessary delays or extensions.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1381--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Confidentiality</span>: respect for sensitive information shared during negotiations is crucial. Confidential
     details whould not be disclosed without consent.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1384--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Limited tort liability</span>: while parties may be held liable for certain costs incurred during the negotiation

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.2   </span> <a id="x1-520002.3.2"></a>Pollicitation</h5>
<!--l. 1408--><p class="noindent">Pollicitation refers to the act of making an offer in the context of contract formation. It is a key step in
initiating contractual negotiations, setting out the terms under which the offeror is willing to enter into a
contract. Let’s break down the essential characteristics of a pollicitation and provide some clarity on its
implications:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1414--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Firmness</span>: an offer must be firm, indicating the offeror’s clear intention to be bound by the offer if
     accepted by the offeree. This means the offeror cannot withdraw the offer arbitrarily before the specified
     time period for acceptance has elapse or, if no time is specified, within a reasonable period. For example,
     a car dealership places an advertisement offering a specific model at a stated price, indicated the offer is
     valid until the end of the month. This is a firm offer because the dealership commits to the terms provided
     until the specified expiration date.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1423--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Precision</span>: the offer must be precise, containing all the essential elements of the contract, notably the price.
     This precision ensures that, upon acceptance, there is a clear agreement on the contract’s fundamental
     terms without the need for further negotiation. For example, an online retailer lists a product with a
     detailed description and price, making it clear what is being offered for sale.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1429--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Express nature</span>: pollicitation must always be express, regardless of its form. It can be communicated
     in various ways, including written, oral, or even through conduct, such as displaying goods for sale in a
     public space. The key is that the offer must unambiguously indicate the offeror’s intention to be bound.
     For example, a company sends a proposal to provide IT services to another business, detailing the scope
     of services and associated costs.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1436--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Public offer</span>: a public offer, one made to an unspecified audience, holds the same legal weight as an
     offer directed at a specific individual. The first party to accept such an offer in accordance with its terms
     effectively enters into a contract with the offeror. For example, a restaurant displaying a sign outside
     offering a lunch special at a specific price. This is binding on the restaurant for anyone who enters and
     orders the special, fulfilling the conditions of the offer.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1444--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Reservations</span>: to mitigate the strictness of this rule, an offer can include certain reservations. For instance,
     the <span class="ecti-1000">intuitu peersonae </span>principle allows the offeror to stipulate that the acceptance must come from a party
     possessing specific qualities or qualifications deemed necessary for the contract’s purpose. For example,
     a job posting requires applicants to have certain qualifications or experience, indicating that only those
     who meet these criteria are eligible to accept the offer of employment.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1452--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Period of time</span>: an offer also includes a time frame for acceptance, which can be explicit or implicit,
     repending on the contract’s nature or intended to be resonable. This period defines how long the offer
     remains open for acceptance, after which it may expire if not accepted. For example, the car sale previously
     mention.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1459--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.3   </span> <a id="x1-530002.3.3"></a>The Regime Governing the Offer</h5>
<!--l. 1461--><p class="noindent">The regime governing the offer outlines the conditions under which an offer can be made, modified, or withdrawn, and
the consequences of these actions.
<!--l. 1465--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-540002.3.3"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Retraction of the offer</span></span>
Generally, an offer is revocable, meaning the offeror can withdraw it before it is accepted. However, an offer becomes
irrevocable if the offeror explicitly states the intention to not withdraw the offer for a certain period or under specific
conditions.
<!--l. 1472--><p class="noindent">If the offeror retracts an irrevocable offer, they may be liable for breach of the promise not to revoke the offer. This
could lead to claims for damages by the offeree or enforcement of a penalty clause, if one was included in the
offer.
<!--l. 1477--><p class="noindent">If the offeror retracts the offer during the period it was supposed to remain open (or before the offeree has had a
reasonable time to consider it, in the absence of a specified period), this action constitutes a fault. If the cancellation
causes damages to the offeree, the offeror may be held liable under tort responsibility.
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1483--><p class="noindent">Public offers: the offeror can freely revoke a public offer unless it has been accepted.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1485--><p class="noindent">Specific person: if the offer targets a specific person, the offeror must allow a reasonable period for the
     offeree to examine and consider the offer before revocation, as established in a 2005 decision by the Cour
     de cassation.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1491--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-550002.3.3"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Lapse of termination of the offer</span></span>
An offer becomes <span class="ecbx-1000">obsolete</span>, meaning it stops producing effects, under certain conditions, such as:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1496--><p class="noindent">The death of the offeror.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1497--><p class="noindent">The offeror undergoing bankruptcy.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1498--><p class="noindent">Sudden incapacity of the offeror.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1500--><p class="noindent">If the offeree initially refuses the offer but then rapidly changes their mind, the initial refusal typically terminates the
offer. However, the legal implications can vary based on the specifics of the situation and the timing of the change of
mind.
<!--l. 1505--><p class="noindent">Jurisprudence is not clear regarding the effect of the offeror’sdeath within the specified time period for acceptance.
Generally, unless the offer is of a personal nature or the contract specifies otherwise, the death of the offeror does not
automatically revoke the offer before its expiration.
<!--l. 1511--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.4   </span> <a id="x1-560002.3.4"></a>Acceptance</h5>
<!--l. 1513--><p class="noindent">Acceptance is a crucial step in the formation of a contract, indicating the offeree’s agreement to the terms proposed by
the offeror.
<!--l. 1516--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-570002.3.4"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Enlightened (Wise) acceptance</span></span>
For acceptance to be valid, it must be informed. The offeree is presumed to be aware of and understand all clauses that
are “readable” and “usual” within the context of the agreement. Clauses that fall outside of what’s considered a tacit
agreement are not deemed accepted unless proven otherwise. This ensures that acceptance is based on a full
understanding of the terms.
<!--l. 1525--><p class="noindent">For example, a person signing a lease agreement is presumed to understand and accept all standard clauses that are
clearly presented and typical for such agreements.
<!--l. 1529--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-580002.3.4"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Pure and simple</span></span>
Acceptance must be unconditional and unambiguous. If the acceptance alters any terms of the offer, it is not considered
a true acceptance but a counter-offer, which effectively nullifies the original offer.
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1535--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Tacit acceptance</span>: can be inferred from the actions of the parties, indicating agreement to the contract
     terms through conduct rather than explicit verbal or wirtten confirmation. For example, using a product
     or service without objection after receiving it can be interpreted as tacit acceptance of the sale terms.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1540--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Silence as acceptance</span>: generally, silence is not considered acceptance. This principle is particularly
     emphasized in consumer law to prevent practices such as forced sales at a distance. An exception exists
     when silence can be contextualized, such as in ongoing business relationships, or specific legal texts allow
     for it, or a letter confirms a previous verbal agreement.</p></li></ul>

     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1560--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Reception theory</span>: a contract is only formed when the acceptance is received by the offeror. This approach
     is more common and practical, ensuring that the offeror is aware of the acceptance before being bound by
     it.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1565--><p class="noindent">For example, if a freelancer sends an email accepting a project offer and the terms are received and acknowledged by
the client, the contract is formed under the reception theory.

<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1571--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Jurisdiction</span>: the location where the contract is considered completed can affect legal jurisdiction, which
     is important for determining the applicable laws and where legal actions can be initiated.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1574--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Revocation of the offer</span>: challenges arise when an offer is revoked after acceptance has been sent but

<!--l. 1643--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecbx-1000">double click rule</span>, introduced in Article 1369-4, emphasizes the need for explicit confirmation of acceptance.
Typically, this involves a process where the user must click once to select an option and again to confirm their choice,
ensuring a deliberate and informed agreement to the contract terms.

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1702--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Mistake</span>: an error by one or more parties about a fundamental aspect of the contract. For example, a

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1707--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Dol</span>: deception by one party to induce another to enter into the contract. For example, if a seller knowingly

<!--l. 1720--><p class="noindent">A <span class="ecbx-1000">mistake </span>occurs when one or both parties hold an incorrect belief about a critical fact at the time of contract

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1736--><p class="noindent">Objective and subjective evaluation: initially, the substance of a mistake was viewed objectively,
         focusing on whether a reasonable person would find the error significant. Over time, the assessment

         important to the contracting party.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1741--><p class="noindent">Concrete VS Abstract Evaluation: the debate centers on whether the significance of the mistake

         (<span class="ecti-1000">in abstracto</span>), affecting the burden of the proof.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 1747--><p class="noindent">A notable case is <span class="ecti-1000">“Le Verrou” </span>case from March 24, 1987. In this case, the controversy involved the sale of an
     artwork attributed to Fragonard. The court ruled that the parties ahd accepted the risk of the painting’s
     authenticity, and the heirs failed to prove that the seller has consented to the sale under a mistaken belief. This
     illustrates the complexity of proving a mistake in contracts involving art, where authenticity may be
     uncertain.

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 1754--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">The obstacle mistake</span>: this refers to a fundamental misunderstanding where there is no true meeting of minds,

<!--l. 2057--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecbx-1000">cause </span>refers to the underlying reason or purpose behind entering into an agreement. It represents the legal and
motivational basis for the obligations that parties undertake through the contract.
<!--l. 2061--><p class="noindent">In classical analysis, the cause is seen as the counterpart for each party’s obligation, analyzed objectively to determine
its legality and existence.
<!--l. 2065--><p class="noindent">The cause must persist throughout the duration of the contract. If the underlying cause of one party’s obligation ceases
to exist, the principle of reciprocity may be compromised, potentially leading to the contract’s resolution for
non-performance.
<!--l. 2070--><p class="noindent">In the modern conception, the existence of the cause is considered from an objective standpoint, separate from the
parties’ subjective motivations, yet crucial for the contract’s validity. The cause must be lawful, meaning it cannot
contravene legal norms or public policy. The assessment of whether a cause is licit involves considering the parties’
intentions and the contract’s circumstances.
<!--l. 2077--><p class="noindent">For example, if the primary motivation for entering a contract is smuggling goods, the cause is deemed illicit, rendering
the contract void.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
<!--l. 2081--><p class="noindent">A <span class="ecbx-1000">false cause </span>occurs when a party is mistaken about the existence of a counterpart or benefit. For instance, entering a

<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2088--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Legal requirement for effectiveness</span>: an obligation without a cause, based on a false cause, or founded

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2092--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Judge’s role</span>: the absense or inadequacy of a cause is subject to judicial review, ensuring that contracts

     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2095--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Special consideration for aleatory contracts</span>: in contracts dependent on chance, the cause relates
     to the risk or chance of an event occurring, which constitutes the aagreement’s basis. For example, in an
     insurance contract, the cause is the risk or chance involved. Participants enter these contracts accepting
     the uncertainty of outcomes as the cause.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 2102--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Chronopost case</span>: this case highlighted the judiciary’s power to nullify clauses that eliminate a contract’s fundamental
obligation, demonstrating how the cause, or its violation, affects contractual obligations. Chronopost offered express
delivery services. The company had contractsthat included clauses limiting its liability for delays in delivery. These
clauses essentially exempted Chronopost from significant responsibility if it failed to meet its express delivery
guarantees. The central issue was whether the limitation of liability clauses were enforceable, especially when the
company failed to meet its guaranteed delivery times. The case reached the Cour de cassation, which held that the
limitation of liability clauses were not enforceable to the extent that they nullified the essential obligation of the
contract, which was timely delivery. The court reasoned that the main cause of the contract from the
customers’ perspective was the guarantee of express delivery. If Chronopost could limit its liability for not
fulfilling this essential obligation, it would undermine the very purpose for which customers entered into the
contracts.

<!--l. 2122--><p class="noindent">The necessity to prove the existence of a cause is particularly emphasized for unilateral contracts with a financial basis,
such as debt acknowledgments.
<!--l. 2125--><p class="noindent">The Article 1132 of the Civil Code articulates that a contract remains valid even if the cause if not explicitly stated
within the document. The obligation is presumed to be for a licit cause, and the burden of prood rests with the
obligation holder to demonstrate this if challenged. However, if there is a claim that the cause is illicit, the proof can be
provided by any means available, reflecting the flexibility in challenging the presumed legality of the
cause.

<!--l. 2135--><p class="noindent">The Civil Code underscores the principle of good faith in the execution of contracts. The Article 1134, paragraph 3,
states that contracts must be executed in good faith, aiming to ensure economic predictability and fairness in
contractual relationships.
<!--l. 2140--><p class="noindent">The objectives and implications of good faith are:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2142--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Economic predictability</span>: good faith execution supports the stability and reliability of commercial
     transactions by ensuring that contracts are carried out according to their agreed terms and spirit.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2145--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Adaptation to circumstances</span>: the principle may require parties to adjust the terms of a contract in
     response to unforeseen circumstances, facilitating the contract’s continuity and preserving the parties’
     relationship.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 2150--><p class="noindent">The sanctions for breaching good faith can be:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2152--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Forced termination</span>: a contract may be terminated if one party violates the principle of good faith,
     undermining the contract’s foundation.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2154--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Forced continuation</span>: conversely, a court may mandate a continuation of a contract, possibly under
     adjusted terms, to rectify a breach of good faith.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 2159--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-790002.6.5"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Relationship to abuse of right theory</span></span>
The principle of good faith is closely related to the theory of abuse of rights, where exercising one’s contractual rights in
a manner intended to harm the other party or in a way that is beyond the contract’s purpose can be
sanctioned.
<!--l. 2166--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-800002.6.5"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Motivation control and limits</span></span>
While good faith imposes behavioral standards on contractual parties, it also respects the autonomy of the contract,
implying that not all motivations or actions can be controlled or penalized under this principle. The application of good
faith is contextual, considering the specifics of each case and the extent to which actions deviate from accepted
standards of fairness and honesty.

<!--l. 2388--><p class="noindent">Intellectual property law is designed to protect creators’ rights to their works, balancing the interests of authors,
intermediaries, and the public.
<!--l. 2392--><p class="noindent">
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a id="x1-940003.1"></a>Introduction</h4>
<!--l. 2394--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-950003.1"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Origins and Historical Background</span></span>
Intellectual property law has evolved significantly over time, tracing back to the Renaissance when the first copyright
laws emerged to protect authors and inventors. The development of IP law reflects the changing societal views on
creativity, innovation, and the dissemination of knowledge.
<!--l. 2402--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-960003.1"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Theoretical foundations</span></span>
The core of IP law lies in recognizing and safeguarding the intellectual and creative labor of individuals, ensuring they
can control and benefit from their creations. This legal framework seeks to stimulate crativity and innovation, while
ensuring that the public can access and build upon existing works.
<!--l. 2410--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.1   </span> <a id="x1-970003.1.1"></a>Substantive Law</h5>
<!--l. 2412--><p class="noindent">The Act of March 11, 1957 marked a shift towards a more industrial viewpoint of intellectual property, emphasizing the
need for robust legal protection of creations without fundamentally altering the nature of copyright law. Its goals
were to enhance legal protection, facilitate the dissemination of works, and streamline the consultation
process.
<!--l. 2418--><p class="noindent">The Acr of July 3, 1985 introduced the codification of IP laws, organizing and clarifying the rules to make them more
accessible and systematic.
<!--l. 2421--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.2   </span> <a id="x1-980003.1.2"></a>Protected Works</h5>
<!--l. 2423--><p class="noindent">To be protected under IP law, according to Article L. 111-1 of the French IP Code, works must be:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2426--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Original</span>: the work has the personal stamp of its creator, reflecting their choices and personality. This
     principle applies across different forms of IP, including copyright and patent law, where the focus is on
     the uniqueness of the expression or invention rather than the novelty or utility.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2431--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Materialized</span>: it needs to be physically done. Ideas are not protected.</p></li></ul>

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.3   </span> <a id="x1-990003.1.3"></a>Originality</h5>
<!--l. 2437--><p class="noindent">Originality is not explicitly defined but is understood as the unique expression of the creator’s personality in the work.
Article L. 112-1 emphasizes that protection covers all intellectual works, regardless of their form, merit, or purpose, as
long as they reflect the author’s personal contribution.
<!--l. 2443--><p class="noindent">This concept is <span class="ecbx-1000">flexible</span>, allowing for a broad interpretation of what contributes a protectable work. This flexibility
extends to adaptations of pre-existing works, which can be considered original if they sufficiently reflect the author’s
personal creativity.
<!--l. 2448--><p class="noindent">For example, Marcel Duchamp’s works, such as his readymades, challenge traditional notions of originality and
creativity. By selecting everyday objects and presenting them as art, Duchamp’s contributions lie in the idea and
conceptual shift rather than in traditional artistic craftmanship. This raises interesting questions about where the line is
drawn between idea and expression in art, reflecting the broader challenges with IP law of defining and protecting
original works.
<!--l. 2456--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.4   </span> <a id="x1-1000003.1.4"></a>Protection Without Formalities</h5>
<!--l. 2458--><p class="noindent">IP law grants authors exclusive rights to their creations without the need for formal registration processes. This
principle, anchored in Article L. 111-1 of the French IP Code, ensures that creators enjoy rights from the moment of
creation, diverging from traditional copyright laws requirinig formal registration.
<!--l. 2464--><p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a id="x1-1010003.1.4"></a><span class="ecbx-1000">Safeguards and systems for protection</span></span>

<!--l. 2466--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">EU Directive 2001</span>: integrated into French law, this directive enhances protections for works shared on
     the Internet, addressing modern challenges in IP law.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2469--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Deposit Systems</span>: while formal registration is not required for protection, deposit systems such as legal
     deposits, public registers for films, audiovisual works, and national registers for designs serve as additional
     safeguards. For example, publishers submitting copies of books to a national library as part of the legal
     system.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2474--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Private Deposit Systems</span>: tools like the Soleau envelope or public notary deposits offer creators a means
     to document the creation date and details of their work, providing evidence that can be useful in disputes.</p></li></ul>

<!--l. 2493--><p class="noindent">The boundary between technical know-how and creative expression poses challenges to IP law, illustrated by varying
court decisions on whether a perfume’s scent can be copyrighted. The Paris Court of Appeal and the Cour de Cassation
have diverged in their rulings, highlighting the complexities of defining what constitutes a protectable
work.

<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2501--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Merit</span>: IP protection is not contingent on a work’s aesthetic value. Video games, for instance, have been
     recognized for legal protection as original intellectual creations regardless of artistic merit.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2504--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Public morals</span>: protection extends to works without regard to their conformity to public morals. However,
     the law remains sensitive to the public interest and moral standards.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2507--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Manual copies</span>: the Cour de Cassation has ruled that manual reproductions of artworks can qualify
     as derivative works eligible for copyright protection, emphasizing the personal touch involved in such
     reproductions. For instance, copies made in a museum are considered a lawful activity as long as the work
     is not sold as an original work of art and it is compulsory to use a canvas of a special size.</p></li></ul>

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 2550--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Contrasting case</span>: the Henri Langlois cinema museum case offered an opposite solution, recognizing
