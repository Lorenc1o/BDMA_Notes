<span class="ecbx-1000">Definition 1.1.</span> </span><span class="ecbx-1000">Rule of Law</span>
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent">General rule imposed on human beings living in society and punished by public authority.
</p></p></div>
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent">
</p></div>
</div>
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecti-1000">rule of Law </span>is a fundamental principle that governs how a society operates. It means that all individuals,
institutions and entities, public or private, including the state itself, are accountable to laws that are publicly
promulgated, equally enforced, and independently adjudicated, and which are consistent with international human
rights principles.
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Characteristics </span>of the <span class="ecti-1000">rule of Law</span>:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Generality</span>: It targets everyone, or some specific kind of people, and it is applied equally.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Mandatory</span>: rules established by law must be followed, and there are consequences of not doing so. This happens
     regardless of the kind of rule:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent">Imperative rules: non-negotiable demands of the law. These define what must or must not be done.
         For example, criminal laws that prohibit theft.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent">Complementary rules: norms that can be modified or set aside by the parties involved, usually in the
         context of private law. For instance, parties entering into a contract can agree on terms that deviate
         from standard legal provisions as long as they do not violate imperative rules or public policy.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent">Both types of rules are mandatory as they establish a framework of legal obligations, but they differ in how
     strictly they bind the parties and their flexibility.
     </p></p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Validity</span>: refers to the legitimacy or authority of the legal rule. For a law to be considered valid:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 148--><p class="noindent">It must be created by a legitimate authority or legislator.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 149--><p class="noindent">It must follow the proper procedure for legislation, which often includes debate, public consultation,
         and adherence to constitutional principles.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 151--><p class="noindent">It must be promulgated or published, making it known to the public before it can be enforced.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 154--><p class="noindent">This characteristic ensures that laws are not arbitrary but are created through a recognized legal process that
     confers legitimacy and legal force.
     </p></p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Sanctionability</span>: once the rule is chosen, it will be applied with the risk of a sanction. Sanctions are the
     consequences or penalties for violating a law, and they serve as a deterrent against illegal behavior. This principle
     is crucial for the rule of law because it ensures that laws are not just theoretical but have practical
     effect.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent">While <span class="ecbx-1000">legal rules </span>are formal, codified norms enforced by the state to regulate behavior and maintain order, <span class="ecbx-1000">moral</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">rules </span>are informal, subjective norms based on ethical principles and values that guide individual behavior. <span class="ecbx-1000">Natural</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">law</span>, meanwhile, is a philosophical theory suggesting the existence of universal, inherent moral principles that should
underpin human-made laws and ethical behavior. Each of these norms plays a distinct role in shaping human conduct,
societal norms, and legal systems.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1   </span> <a id="x1-30001.1"></a>Classification of Legal Rules</h4>
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 174--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Public Law</span>: governs the relationship between individuals and the state, as well as the relationships between
     different branches of the state. It is subcaterogized as:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 178--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Constitutional Law</span>: the foundation of the legal system of a country. It outlines the structure of
         the government, the distribution of powers among different branches (executive, legislative, judicial),
         and the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens. It is the highest law, against which all other
         laws are evaluated.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Administrative  Law</span>:  covers  the  rules  and  procedures  that  govern  administrative  agencies  of
         the government. It deals with the actions and decisions of government departments and agencies,
         including rulemaking, enforcement of laws, issuing permits, and resolving disputes involving public
         administration.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">International  Public  Law</span>:  governs  the  conduct  of  states  and  international  organizations.  It
         encompasses treaties, conventions, and customs that regulate interactions between sovereign nations,
         including issues related to war, diplomacy, human rights, and territorial boundaries.</p></li></ul>
</p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Private Law</span>: deals with the relationships between private individuals or entities. It governs legal disputes that
     involve private parties and their rights and obligations. It is subcategorized as:
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">International Private Law</span>: deals with cases where foreign elements are involved, determining
         which jurisdiction’s law applies to a legal dispute and how judgements from one jurisdiction are
         recognized and enforced in another. For example, when two parties from different countries sign
         a contract, the matter of deciding which national law shall apply to the contract is a matter of
         international private law.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Civil Law</span>: the core of private law. It covers non-criminal disputes between individuals and entities,
         including laws on contracts, property, family relations, and inheritance. It establishes the rights and
         duties of private parties in their interactions.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Commercial Law</span>: it is a subset of civil law, that deals with issues related to commerce and trade
         between businesses and individuals, including contracts, transactions and business organization.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 211--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Labor  Law</span>:  this  area  governs  the  relationship  between  employers  and  employees,  including
         employment contracts, labor rights, working conditions and collective bargaining.</p></li></ul>
</p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 215--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Mixed</span>:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 217--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Procedural Law</span>: encompasses the rules that govern how courts and other legal institutions handle
         civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings. It includes the procedures for filing cases, conducting
         trials, and appealing decisions.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 221--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Criminal Law</span>: governs crimes and punishments. It defines what constitutes criminal behavior and
         specifies the sanctions (punishments) for such behavior. While it primarily deals with offenses against
         the state or society at large, it has elements of both public law (the state prosecutes offenders) and
         private law (in aspects like victim compensation).</p></li></ul>

<!--l. 231--><p class="noindent">
<ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4002x1">
<!--l. 232--><p class="noindent">Before the French Revolution, local laws in what is now France were divided between the <span class="ecbx-1000">Germanic</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">customary laws </span>in the north and the <span class="ecbx-1000">Roman laws </span>in the south. There laws were based on local customs
     and traditions, with Roman law influencing the legal systems due to the Roman Empire’s historical
     presence.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4004x2">
<!--l. 237--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Ordinances and Edicts of the King </span>began to replace local customary laws. Ordinances were more
     general laws, while edicts could address specific issues or grant rights and privileges. This centralization
     of legal authority under the monarchy was a step towards a unified legal system.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4006x3">
<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent">In the <span class="ecti-1000">ancien r</span><span class="ecti-1000">égime </span>of France, there were <span class="ecbx-1000">Parlements</span>, which were sovereign courts that registered the
     king’s edicts and could protest against them, although they could not ultimately prevent their enforcement.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4008x4">
<!--l. 246--><p class="noindent">In addition, there was the <span class="ecbx-1000">Canon Law</span>, the law governing the Church and its members, which was
     a significant source of law in Europe before the French revolution, especially in matters of marriage,
     legitimacy and inheritance.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4010x5">
<!--l. 250--><p class="noindent">Now, there are other sources of the contemporary law, divided into international and national sources:
         <ol class="enumerate2">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4012x1">
<!--l. 253--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">International Sources</span>: <span class="ecbx-1000">treaties </span>are international agreements that countries are bound to follow.
         The article 55 of the French Constitution acknowledges the superiority of treaties over national
         laws, provided they are ratified according to the constitution. In addition, there is the <span class="ecbx-1000">European</span>
<span class="ecbx-1000">Union Law</span>, which is based on the Treaty of Rome (1957), that established the European Economic
         Community, now part of the European Union. EU law includes regulations and directives issued
         by EU institutions like the European Commision and the European Council, which have direct or
         indirect effect on member states’ laws and take precedence over national legislation.
         </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4014x2">
<!--l. 263--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">National Sources</span>: the <span class="ecbx-1000">Law </span>referes to statutes passed by the Parliament, while <span class="ecbx-1000">regulations </span>are
         issued by the executive branch (the government) and deal with matters not expressly reserved for
         law. In addition, there are <span class="ecbx-1000">decrees </span>and <span class="ecbx-1000">orders</span>, which are forms of regulation dealing with specific
         issues or individual matters, not considered as the law in the broader sense. For example, a decree
         might appoint public officials to certain administrative positions, or an order might impose temporary
         restrictions on water use in response to a severe drought in a department.</p></li></ol>
</p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-4016x6">
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent">Finally, we find the <span class="ecbx-1000">Constitution</span>, which is the supreme legal document, defining the fundamental principles and
     the organization of the state. It outlines the domain of laws passed by Parliament (matters of personal status,
     fundamental principles) and the Executive branch’s authority to issue regulations on matters not covered by law,
     except as specified in articles 38 and 16 of the French Constitution. Article 38 allows the government to legislate
     by ordinance in areas delegated by Parliament, while Article 16 grants the President exceptional powers under
     certain crisis conditions.</p></li></ol>
<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent">
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3   </span> <a id="x1-50001.3"></a>Drafting of a Law</h4>

<ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">
<!--l. 286--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Initiative</span>: the process of creating a new law begins with the initiative, which can be taken by the Prime
     Minister or member of the Parliament. This involves the drafting and proposal of a new law.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5004x2">
<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Examination and voting</span>: the proposed law is examined, debated, and voted on by each assembly of
     Parliament (the National Assembly and the Senate).
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">
<!--l. 293--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Promulgation</span>: after a law is passed by Parliament, it is promulgated by the President of the Republic
     through a decree. Promulgation is the formal declaration that the law is enforceable.
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x4">
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Publication</span>: the law is then published in the official gazette, and it becomes enforceable the day after
     its publication.</p></li></ol>
<!--l. 299--><p class="noindent">In addition, it must be ensured that the law complies with higher sources of law:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Constitutionality</span>: the Constitutional Council examines the constitutionality of the new law before its
     promulgation. This can be requested as a preliminary ruling on constitutionality.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 305--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Review of legality</span>: there’s also a mechanism for reviewing the legality of regulations, which can be
     challenged a posteriori (after the fact) by someone claiming a legitimate interest, either by <span class="ecti-1000">“voie d’action”</span>
     (direct action) or <span class="ecti-1000">“voie d’exception” </span>(as a defense in court proceedings).</p></li></ul>

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3.1   </span> <a id="x1-60001.3.1"></a>Revoke of Laws and Regulations</h5>
<!--l. 314--><p class="noindent">Laws and regulations do not automatically fall into disuse: they must be explicitly or implicitly revoked. The principle
is that law remain in force until revoked.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3.2   </span> <a id="x1-70001.3.2"></a>Case Law or Judicial Precedence</h5>
<!--l. 320--><p class="noindent">Judges in France are expected to enforce the law. However, judicial decisions can create law under certain conditions,
such as when the law is unclear or when new, unforeseen situations arise. Article 4 of the Civil Code mandates that
judges must make a decision even in the absence of clear, precise laws, under penalty of being charged with denial of
justice.
<!--l. 327--><p class="noindent">However, according to Article 1355 of the Civil Code, a judgment only has authority in relation to the specific case it
resolves and does not create regulatory judgments applicable to all.
<!--l. 331--><p class="noindent">Therefore... <span class="ecbx-1000">do judges create the rule of law?</span>
<!--l. 333--><p class="noindent">While judges do not create laws in the legislative sense, their interpretations and decisions in unclear or new situations
can influence the development of the law. They do not create rules that have general applicability like laws passed by
Parliament, but can set precedents within the bounds of existing laws
<!--l. 339--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3.3   </span> <a id="x1-80001.3.3"></a>Other Sources of Law</h5>
<!--l. 341--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Customs </span>are established practices that are considered legally binding, even though they are not formal laws.
Customs can be used to interpret and complete the law, provided they are not <span class="ecti-1000">contra legem </span>(against the
law).
<!--l. 346--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Legal doctrine </span>refers to scholarly legal writings that can influence legal interpretations and the development of the
law. Legal doctrine is not binding like laws or regulations but can be persuasive in legal reasoning and
decision-making.

<!--l. 362--><p class="noindent">The principle is the <span class="ecbx-1000">non-retroactivity of Laws</span>. Article 2 of the Civil Code states that a new law applies only to the
future and does not have a retroactive effect. This means that actions taken and situations that arose before the new
law’s enactment are governed by the law as it was at that time. The rationale behind this principle is to protect legal
certainty and individual’s trust in the law, ensuring that people can plan their actions according to the law without fear
of future changes affecting them retroactively.
<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent">However, the new law may apply to ongoing legal situations without retroactive effect. For instance, a
new law may apply to continuing contracts or relationships, affecting the rights and obligations of the
parties from the date of the law’s enactment forward, without altering the legal situation that existed
before.

<!--l. 382--><p class="noindent">More clement criminal laws: if a new criminal law is more favorable to the defendant, it can be
         applied retroactively to past actions. This exception is rooted in the principle of lenity (courts should
         interpret the law in the way most favorable to the defendant), which aims to ensure fairness in the
         administration of justice.

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 387--><p class="noindent">Interpretative laws: these laws clarify the intended meaning of previous legislation without changing

     used as proof:

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.7.3   </span> <a id="x1-240001.7.3"></a>Use of Evidence</h5>
<!--l. 702--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Statutory facts </span>are those that must be established or proven in court to meet the legal criteria set by statutes for
various purposes, like determining legal rights or liabilities, qualifying for exceptions or exemptions, or triggering or
preventing legal actions. For example, in the context of family law, statutory facts might include the circumstances
of a marriage or the parentage of a child, which are relevant to legal issues like custody, support, and
inheritance.
<!--l. 710--><p class="noindent">The use of evidence in statutory facts is characterized by being free for civil status or filiation: this means that for
matters concerning an individual’s civil status (e.g., birth, marriage, death) or filiation (determining parent-child
relationship), the law allows flexibility in the types of evidence that can be presented, except in certain cases where
specific legal restrictions may apply.
<!--l. 717--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Proof by legal documents </span>(article 1341 of the Civil Code): legal documents are the primary source of evidence for
asserting claims or defenses in court. These documents need to meet certain legal requirements to be considered
valid.
<!--l. 722--><p class="noindent">In principle, documentary evidence is needed:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 724--><p class="noindent">In principle, <span class="ecbx-1000">a legal document is necessary</span>: generally, a written document is required to prove a legal
     act or transaction, reflecting the principle that written evidence provides a clear and durable record of
     agreements, rights and obligations.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 728--><p class="noindent">Exceptions  -  <span class="ecbx-1000">Oaths  and  Admission</span>:  in  situations  where  a  legal  document  is  not  available,  an
     individual’s oath (solemn promise regarding the truth of the information provided) or admission (a party’s
     acknowledgement of a fact) can be accepted as evidence. In commercial litigation, the rules are more
     indulgent, allowing a wider range of evidence to be used (free evidence).
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 734--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Prima Facie Evidence </span>(Article 1347): refers to evidence that is accepted as sufficient to proof a fact unless
     contradicted and overcome by other evidence. It includes situations where:
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 738--><p class="noindent">It was materially or morally impossible to create a legal document at the time of the transaction.

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 747--><p class="noindent">Proof against or beyond a legal document: if evidence is presented that contradicts or extends beyond what is

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.8   </span> <a id="x1-250001.8"></a>The Legal System</h4>
<!--l. 755--><p class="noindent">In France, there is what is called a <span class="ecbx-1000">Dual Jurisdiction</span>, which refers to the coexistence of two main types of
jurisdiction: administrative and judicial:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 759--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Administrative Jurisdiction</span>: Deals with disputes involving public administration, government agencies,
     and the actions of the government. It is separate from the ordinary courts and has its own hierarchy, with
     the Council of State (Conseil d’État) at the top.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 763--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Judicial Jurisdiction</span>: Handles civil and criminal cases involving individuals and private law disputes.
     This jurisdiction is what most people typically encounter when they go to court.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 766--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Court of Jurisdictional Conflict</span>: A special court that resolves disputes over whether a case should be
     heard by the administrative or judicial courts, ensuring that there is a clear demarcation between the two
     jurisdictions.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 771--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecbx-1000">principle of Double Degree of Jurisdiction </span>guarantees that most decisions from a first instance court can be
appealed to a higher court. It’s a fundamental right ensuring that parties have the opportunity for a second hearing.
However, there are exceptions for minor cases, where appeals may be limited to prevent an overload of the judicial
system.
<!--l. 778--><p class="noindent">We also find a classification of courts, regarding their hierarchy and specialization. For instance, courts dealing with
criminal matters are classified according to <span class="ecbx-1000">criminal jurisdictions</span>:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 782--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Tribunal de police</span>: deals with minor offenses (contraventions).
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 783--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Tribunal correctionnel</span>: handles more serious offenses (délits) but not crimes.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 785--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Cour d’assises</span>: deals with the most serious offenses (crimes) and includes a jury.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 787--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Exceptional jurisdictions</span>: includes a court for specific types of defendants or crimes, such as minors or
     members of the government.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 790--><p class="noindent">In addition, there are <span class="ecbx-1000">civil jurisdictions</span>, which handle disputes between individuals and organizations, and disputes
not classified as criminal:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 794--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">First instance court</span>: courts that hear a case for the first time, including the merged <span class="ecti-1000">“tribunaux de grande</span>
<span class="ecti-1000">instance” </span>and <span class="ecti-1000">“tribunaux d’instance”</span>, and specialized courts for commercial disputes (whose decisions can
     be subject to appeal above 4000<span class="tcrm-1000">€</span>), labor disputes (<span class="ecti-1000">Conseil de prud’hommes</span>), and others. Here, there is
     a judge in charge of the litigation of the protection.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 800--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Cour d’Appel</span>: the court that hears appeals from decisions of first instance courts, reviewing facts and
     law.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 802--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Cour de cassation</span>: the highest court in French legal system, which reviews lower court decisions to
     ensure they correctly applied the law. It does not retry cases but instead focuses on legal principles. Its
     decisions are final, and it can return cases for a new trial if it finds a lower court decision was based on a
     misinterpretation of the law.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 810--><p class="noindent">
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.9   </span> <a id="x1-260001.9"></a>Civil Proceedings</h4>
<!--l. 812--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">The Transaction </span>(Article 2044 of the Civil Code) refers to a legal mechanism where parties in a dispute reach an
agreement to resolve their issues without going to trial. It’s a form of settlement that is legally binding and often used
to avoid lengthy and costly proceedings.
<!--l. 818--><p class="noindent">The <span class="ecbx-1000">judicial staff </span>is categorized into judges (magistrates) and prosecutors, with distinctions between their roles and
personal status:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 822--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Judges/Magistrates</span>: can be non-professional (in commercial or labor courts, for example, it is possible
     that a matter is subject to a non-professional judge, who is an expert in the matter) or professional (people
     that have studied to be a judge), with the primary responsibility of resolving disputes by interpreting
     laws, assessing the facts of the case, and issuing judgements accordingly. They are part of the <span class="ecti-1000">“Si</span><span class="ecti-1000">ège”</span>,
     which means they cannot be removed from a case and their role is to judge and resolve disputes based on
     the law.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 830--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Prosecutors</span>: include the <span class="ecti-1000">“procureur de la R</span><span class="ecti-1000">épublique” </span>at the first instance level, <span class="ecti-1000">“procureur g</span><span class="ecti-1000">én</span><span class="ecti-1000">éral” </span>at

     officials are part of the <span class="ecti-1000">“Parquet” </span>and are responsible for leading prosecutions (i.e. charging someone with
     a crime and conducting the trial to prove they are guilty of that crimw), including the cross-examination of
     cases. Their role is to enforce the law and ensure public order. Prosecutors are legal officials who represents
     the state or the public in criminal trials.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 841--><p class="noindent">In addition, there are various professionals who assist the functioning of the judicial system:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 844--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Greffiers  (clerks  of  the  court)</span>:  responsible  for  maintaining  the  records  of  court  proceedings  and

<!--l. 861--><p class="noindent">Finally, we find the <span class="ecbx-1000">Judicial Court</span>, which involves several aspects:
