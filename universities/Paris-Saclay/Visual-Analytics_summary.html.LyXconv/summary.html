<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent">We all know about the increasing amount of data collected and handled by companies and organizations, but it is also
important to understand that data is not the same as information: it is needed a process of analysis and understanding
to derive information from data. When we have a question that we want to answer with our data, we <span class="ecbx-1000">query </span>the data
seeking for the pieces of data that might be relevant for our questions. On the other hand, when we aren’t sure what
we’re looking for, we <span class="ecbx-1000">explore </span>the data, looking for patterns that can give us insights and ideas we didn’t thought about
before.
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent">Moreover, purely relying on automated analyses is not always effective due to potential unexpected results, usually
because of edge cases and situations that we did not think about at the beginning or which did not even exist by then,
and because data can be incomplete, inconsistent or deceptive. Therefore, human judgement and intervention is often
needed, to provide background information, flexible analysis, modifiable to unintended directions and creativity.
<span class="ecbx-1000">Visual analytics </span>is then a field that provides different tools to have a human in the loop in analysis
tasks.
<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent">In this course, we want to build a strong critical thinking with data, relying on visualizations that can help us to better
understand data. We will delve into the topics of Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis and
Visualization.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.1   </span> <a id="x1-40001.1.1"></a>What is Data Analysis</h5>
<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent">Traditionally, there is the vision that data analysis consists in applying statistics to analyze data collected from the real
world, but a more accurate vision would be to define data analysis as the task of thinking carefully about evidence,
represented by data. Nowadays, this view is more spread, and data analysis is now covering a wide range of activities
and skills:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 136--><p class="noindent">Problem definition
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">

<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent">
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.2   </span> <a id="x1-50001.1.2"></a>Visual Analytics</h5>
<!--l. 144--><p class="noindent">Visual Analytics is the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual interfaces. It combines automated
analysis techniques with interactive visualizations for an effective understanding, reasoning and decision making on the
basis of very large and complex data sets.
<!--l. 149--><p class="noindent">The greatest challenge of visual analytics is to enable deep insights, allowing analysts to examine massive,
multi-dimensional, multi-source and time-varying information, to make the right decisions in a time-critical manner.
With this in mind, the method is to combine automated analysis with human intervention, and representing data
visually to allow for interaction, insight generation, conclusions making and enabling for better decision
making.
<!--l. 157--><p class="noindent">The field can be understood as a whole, but it can also be divided into:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 160--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Information Visualization</span>: visualizations that enable to transmit information to the general public in
     a clear way.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Scientific Visualization</span>: visualizations that show scientific work and discoveries with precision.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 164--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Infographics</span>: this represents a visual summary of a topic that aims at providing an easy-to-understand
     overview on a topic.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 167--><p class="noindent">As mentioned before, there are basically two approaches towards data analysis:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Confirmatory Analysis</span>: starts with a hypothesis about the data and tries to confirm its validity. This
     kind of analysis focuses more on fully automated analysis methods.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 173--><p class="noindent"><span class="ecbx-1000">Exploratory Analysis</span>: when there is no or little a-priori information about the data and we are not sure
     about which patterns and information can be present in the data, we can explore it to create hypotheses
     that will need to be confirmed later. It is in this area where visual analytics is most widely used.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 179--><p class="noindent">We can also understand visual analytics as a process, involving the following steps:
     <ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5002x1">
<!--l. 182--><p class="noindent">Information (data) gathering
     </p></li>

<!--l. 183--><p class="noindent">Data preprocessing
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5006x3">

     </p></li>
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-5010x5">
<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent">Decision making</p></li></ol>
<!--l. 188--><p class="noindent">Therefore, the requirements for an interesting and efficient visualization analytics approach are the development and
understaing of data transformations and analysis algorithms, analytical reasoning techniques, visual representations and
interactions, and techniques for production, presentation and dissemination.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1.3   </span> <a id="x1-60001.1.3"></a>History of Visual Analytics</h5>
<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent">In the early 2000s, there was an outgrowth of the Scientific &amp; Information Visualization community, which started with
US National Visualization and Analytics Center (NVAC) at PNNL in 2004. This center developed the first research and
development agenda “Illuminating the Path” sponsored initially by DHS (US Department of Homeland Security). At
first, the goals of this center and of the field were analyzing terrorist threats, safeguarding boarders and ports, and
preparing for and responding to emergencies.
<!--l. 205--><p class="noindent">The field has evolved since then to serve for larger research goals, specially since the first edition of the VAST
symposium, a conference in visual analytics, science and technology, as part of the IEEE Visualizations Conference, in
2006; in addition to fundation of the VisMaster in 2008 by the EU. This represented a coordination action to join
European academic and industrial R&amp;D, with a focus in broader aplicability in different scientific fields (physics,
astronomy, weather,...) rather than homeland security. From this point on, many centers in Europe have been created to
research in this field.

<!--l. 286--><p class="noindent">We tend to think of data as a thing stored in a database, or somewhere,... but in reality data has been collected using
some methodology, and with many decisions taken before and during the process.
<!--l. 290--><p class="noindent">This is because the data was collected for some reason, and therefore was defined to give light on certain questions, and
restricted to the measure devices that were available. However, having collected the data is not the same as already
having the answers to our questions: we need to analyze it.
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent">Analysis is a cycle, in which two big tasks are alternated:
     <ol class="enumerate1">
<li class="enumerate" id="x1-10002x1">
<!--l. 298--><p class="noindent">Gathering  data,  applying  statistical  tools,  and  constructing  graphics  to  address  questions,  to  obtain
     answers.

<li class="enumerate" id="x1-10004x2">
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent">Inspect the answers and assess new questions.</p></li></ol>
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent">There are times when we already have the data, and we want to perform <span class="ecbx-1000">exploratory data analysis </span>to search for
patterns and questions that could be answered. But oftentimes we have a question, and we need to collect the data
somehow:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 307--><p class="noindent">Collect it ourselves:
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
         <ul class="itemize2">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 309--><p class="noindent">Surveys: which can be paper surveys, on-line or in-person interviews. It still represents one of the
         best ways to get detailed data or data about sensitive subjects.
         <!--l. 313--><p class="noindent">Recently, it has become popular the concept of crowdsourcing data collection, which consists basically
         in publishing on-line surveys and people get paid for completing them.
         </p></p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 316--><p class="noindent">Web logging: concists in tracking visits, click-throughs, and traffic patterns, along with other measures
         of user activity. There are tools such as Google Analytics or Open Web Analytics that allow this
         kind of analysis. A special kind of these analyses are the Edits &amp; Accesses logs on wikipedia.

     collected.
     <!--l. 348--><p class="noindent">Moreover, there are many companies that provides an API to access their data, it can be free, or they may ask for
     a fee or a license.
     <!--l. 351--><p class="noindent">Another way to extract data from the Internet, when there is not an available API, is by scraping the data. It
     consists on accessing the pages where the information is using a program that collects this information. This is
     usually a complex approach, and there are tools we can use to avoid scraping:

<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 362--><p class="noindent"><span id="textcolor5">Advantages</span>: cheap and fast.
         </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 363--><p class="noindent"><span id="textcolor6">Disadvantages</span>: needs data cleaning and understanding of the sources. Also, it is hard to assess the

<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent">If we need to build a Web Scraper, we should separate it into two different processes:
     <ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 374--><p class="noindent">Data fetching: it is advisable to download the complete pages and save them locally before processing
     them, specially if the data is spread across multiple pages, needing pagination.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 377--><p class="noindent">Parsing data: once we have our web pages stored locally, we can process them calmly. Another tip is to
     use the browsers’ built-in tools for page inspection.</p></li></ul>
<!--l. 381--><p class="noindent">One need also to take into account that some sites are protected against data scraping, and we could get blocked. To
get around this, we could introduce delays in the scraper, or use VPNs,...
<!--l. 385--><p class="noindent">
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2   </span> <a id="x1-120003.2"></a>Data Formats</h4>
<ul class="itemize1">
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 387--><p class="noindent">Structured data: the kind of data that we can find in a spreadsheet or a database. It has a fixed schema
     and data types definition.
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 389--><p class="noindent">Unstructured data: includes raw text, streaming data, images, videos,... Basically there is no control over
     the structure of the different data points.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
     </p></li>
<li class="itemize">
<!--l. 392--><p class="noindent">Semi-structured data: is more organized than the unstructured data, but does not follow a fixed schema.
     It could have a flexible schema, a multilayer schema, etc. For example JSON files.</p></li></ul>

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3   </span> <a id="x1-150003.3"></a>Handling Data</h4>
<!--l. 416--><p class="noindent">It is important to always keep backups of our data, and to password protect or encrypt any data with sensitive
information.
<!--l. 419--><p class="noindent">In addition, it is important to take <span class="ecbx-1000">provenance </span>into account. We need to keep track of where and when data was
collected, as well as to record any data processing steps we took, so they can be reproduced.
<!--l. 423--><p class="noindent">Regarding intellectual property, copyright and sharing data, it is crucial to be sure to know who owns the data, and to
think early whether it will be possible to publish the data or not, as well as not to violate copyright (specially when
scraping data).
<!--l. 428--><p class="noindent">Not only this, but any information that could be used to identify individuals is sensitive, and there might be legal
repercussions for releasing it. It is important to be aware when to anonymize data before sharing. Also, regarding
<span class="ecbx-1000">anonymization</span>, it is important to note that just removing names is not enough, as there have been
several studies showing how combining different publicly available anynomized datasets, individuals can be
identified.
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
<!--l. 436--><p class="noindent">We need to comply with the <span class="ecbx-1000">regulations</span>, and usually Institutional Review and Ethics Boards will need to
approve the experiments or the data collection process before it happens, specially for studies involving
people, which may even need informed consent. Moreover, in some cases there are limits on how long user
data can be kept, or how the user should be notified when their data is tracked (through cookies for
example).
<!--l. 444--><p class="noindent">In Europe, there is the <span class="ecbx-1000">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</span>, which is the world’s strongest data
protection law and defines how organizations can handle information about people. It defines what is personal data, as
data from which people can be identified, and requires strict treatment for this kind of data. This processing should be
lawful, fair and transparent, and get ethics approval. It is advisable to process the minimal amount of necessary
personal data, and to anonymize it where possible.
