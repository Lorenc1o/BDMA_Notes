# University material from Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree in Big Data Management and Analytics (BDMA)
### Jose Antonio Lorencio Abril

[EN]

In this repository you will find the material that I have developed during my studies in the BDMA program.

The material is organised by university and by subject, although I only show those subjects for which I have developed a sufficient amount of my own study material.

I hope that someone will find my work useful, as I think it makes no sense for it to be stored on my computer, gathering digital dust. I do ask you not to use this material fraudulently.

Anything else: joseantoniolorencio@gmail.com .
