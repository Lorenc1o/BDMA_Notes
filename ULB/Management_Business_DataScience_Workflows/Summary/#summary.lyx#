\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Business Process Management (BPM)
\series default
 is a 
\emph on
body of methods, techniques, and tools to identify, discover, analyze, redesign,
 execute, and monitor business processes in order to optimize their performance
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that BPM is interested in understanding how an organization performs
 their work, focusing in the abstraction of the chain of activities performed
 by different actors of the organization, and not that much in how the actual
 individuals carry out these activities.
 These chains of tasks carried out in an organization with a defined objective
 that are subject to the BPM analysis are called 
\series bold
\emph on
business processes
\series default
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely, Dumas defines a business process 
\emph on
as a collection of inter-related events, activities, and decision points
 that involve a number of actors and objects, which collectively lead to
 an outcome that is of value to at least one customer
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relevant concepts in this definition are the following: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Events: things that have no duration.
 For example, receiving an e-mail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Activities: things that take time to be fulfilled.
 For example, answering a received e-mail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Decision points: these points happen when the process changes depending
 on a decision or an outcome of a past activity.
 For example, we might answer to the e-mail only if it is relevant for us
 and let it be otherwise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Actors: people, organizations and systems that take part in a process.
 For example, me and a guy from the other side of the world claiming to
 be my cousin and willing to make me rich.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Objects: the objects involved in the process, being physical or informational
 objects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BPM Notation (BPMN) is a visual language developed to model business processes
 and facilitate their analysis, understanding and communication between
 different stakeholders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Some common processes.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Order-to-cash
\emph default
: type of process performed by a vendor.
 It starts when a customer submits an order to purchase a product and ends
 when the product has been delivered to the customer and the customer has
 made the payment for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Quote-to-order
\emph default
: typically precedes an order-to-cash process.
 It starts from the point when a supplier receives a Request for Quote (RFQ)
 from a customer, and ends when the customer in question places a purchase
 order based on the received quote.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Quote-to-cash
\emph default
: is the combination of two corresponding quote-to-order and order-to-cash
 processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Procure-to-pay
\emph default
: starts when someone in an organization determines that a given product
 or service needs to be purchased.
 It ends when the product has been delivered and paid for.
 A procure-to-pay process implies a quote-to-cash process on the supplier's
 side.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsection
The BPM lifecycle
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BPM procedure is divided into a series of steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Process identification
\emph default
: identify all processes that take place in an organization's work.The outcome
 of this phase is a 
\series bold
process architecture
\series default
:
\series bold
 
\series default
a collection of inter-linked processes covering the bulk of the work that
 an organization performs in order to achieve its mission in a sustainable
 manner.
 To create such an architecture which is able to consistently produce positive
 outcomes, it is needed to:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Measure the value
\emph default
 delivered by processes.
 There are different types of measures, related to cost, time, amount of
 errors,...
 And it is needed to decide which measures will be taken into account.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Process discovery
\emph default
: understand the business process in detail.
 After this phase, we obtain as outcome the 
\series bold
as-is process models
\series default
, which reflect the understanding that people in the organization have about
 how work is done.
 These are commonly expressed by means of diagrams, which help in the comprehens
ion of the process, and enhance the dicussion about it.
 It is usual to use the BPMN.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Process analysis
\emph default
: identification of issues and opportunities for process improvement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Process redesign
\emph default
: identification and analysis of potential remedies for the issues encountered
 during the analysis phase.
 The output of this phase is new redesigned version of the process, the
 
\series bold
to-be process
\series default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\emph on
Process implementation
\emph default
: it is needed to make the necessary changes in the ways of working and
 the IT systems of the organization so that the to-be process can be put
 into execution.
 These are in fact the two facets that an organization faces when dealing
 with process implementation:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Organizational change management.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Process automation
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Finally, we would go back to the process discovery phase, as this is an
 iterative approach, where processes are constantly changed to deal with
 the inherent changing nature of businesses.
